states. Negro boys and girls, men and women, insulted,
arrested, hounded out of town, beaten, molested, and
killed for imaginary, or at the most, ridiculously small

<p>Being a non-commercial product interested only
in the arts, it is necessary that we make some
appeal for aid from interested friends. For the
second issue of Fire we would appreciate having
fifty people subscribe ten dollars each, and fifty
more to subscribe five dollars each.</p>

<p>We make no eloquent or rhetorical plea. Fire
speaks for itself.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_006-fancyletter.png" style="width:2.5em;"
alt="">
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>Physically</i>, if not mentally, Cordelia was a
potential prostitute, meaning that although
she had not yet realized the moral import of
her wanton promiscuity nor become mercenary,
she had, nevertheless, become quite blasé and
bountiful in the matter of bestowing sexual favors
upon persuasive and likely young men. Yet, despite
her seeming lack of discrimination, Cordelia was
quite particular about the type of male to whom she
submitted, for numbers do not necessarily denote a
lack of taste, and Cordelia had discovered after several
months of active observation that one could find
the qualities one admires or reacts positively to in
a varied hodge-podge of outwardly different individuals.</p>

<p>The scene of Cordelia’s activities was The Roosevelt
Motion Picture Theatre on Seventh Avenue
near 145th Street. Thrice weekly the program
changed, and thrice weekly Cordelia would plunk
down the necessary twenty-five cents evening admission
fee, and saunter gaily into the foul-smelling
depths of her favorite cinema shrine. The Roosevelt
Theatre presented all of the latest pictures,
also, twice weekly, treated its audiences to a vaudeville
bill, then too, one could always have the most
delightful physical contacts ... hmm....</p>

<p>Cordelia had not consciously chosen this locale
nor had there been any conscious effort upon her
part to take advantage of the extra opportunities
afforded for physical pleasure. It had just happened
that the Roosevelt Theatre was more close to her
home than any other neighborhood picture palace,
and it had also just happened that Cordelia had
become almost immediately initiated into the ways
of a Harlem theatre chippie soon after her discovery
of the theatre itself.</p>

<p>It is the custom of certain men and boys who frequent
these places to idle up and down the aisle
until some female is seen sitting alone, to slouch
down into a seat beside her, to touch her foot or
else press her leg in such a way that it can be construed
as accidental if necessary, and then, if the
female is wise or else shows signs of willingness to
become wise, to make more obvious approaches until,
if successful, the approached female will soon
be chatting with her baiter about the picture being
shown, lolling in his arms, and helping to formulate
plans for an after-theatre rendezvous. Cordelia had,
you see, shown a willingness to become wise upon
her second visit to The Roosevelt. In a short while
she had even learned how to squelch the bloated,
lewd faced Jews and eager middle aged Negroes
who might approach as well as how to inveigle the
likeable little yellow or brown half men, embryo
avenue sweetbacks, with their well modeled heads,
stickily plastered hair, flaming cravats, silken or
broadcloth shirts, dirty underwear, low cut vests,
form fitting coats, bell-bottom trousers and shiny
shoes with metal cornered heels clicking with a
brave, brazen rhythm upon the bare concrete floor as
their owners angled and searched for prey.</p>

<p>Cordelia, sixteen years old, matronly mature, was
an undisciplined, half literate product of rustic
South Carolina, and had come to Harlem very much
against her will with her parents and her six
brothers and sisters. Against her will because she
had not been at all anxious to leave the lackadaisical
life of the little corn pone settlement where she had
been born, to go trooping into the unknown vastness
of New York, for she had been in love,
passionately in love with one John Stokes who
raised pigs, and who, like his father before him,
found the raising of pigs so profitable that he could
not even consider leaving Lintonville. Cordelia had
blankly informed her parents that she would not
go with them when they decided to be lured to New
York by an older son who had remained there after
the demobilization of the war time troops. She had
even threatened to run away with John until they
should be gone, but of course John could not leave
his pigs, and John’s mother was not very keen on
having Cordelia for a daughter-in-law—those
Joneses have bad mixed blood in ’em—so Cordelia
had had to join the Gotham bound caravan and
leave her lover to his succulent porkers.</p>

<p>However, the mere moving to Harlem had not
doused the rebellious flame. Upon arriving Cordelia
had not only refused to go to school and refused
to hold even the most easily held job, but had
also victoriously defied her harassed parents so frequently
when it came to matters of discipline that
she soon found herself with a mesmerizing lack of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
home restraint, for the stress of trying to maintain
themselves and their family in the new
environment was far too much of a task for
Mr. and Mrs. Jones to attend to facilely
and at the same time try to control a recalcitrant
child. So, when Cordelia had refused
either to work or to attend school, Mrs. Jones herself
had gone out for day’s work, leaving Cordelia at
home to take care of their five room railroad flat,
the front room of which was rented out to a couple
“living together,” and to see that the younger children,
all of whom were of school age, made their
four trips daily between home and the nearby public
school—as well as see that they had their greasy, if
slim, food rations and an occasional change of clothing.
Thus Cordelia’s days were full—and so were
her nights. The only difference being that the days
belonged to the folks at home while the nights (since
the folks were too tired or too sleepy to know or
care when she came in or went out) belonged to
her and to—well—whosoever will, let them come.</p>

<p>Cordelia had been playing this hectic, entrancing
game for six months and was widely known among a
certain group of young men and girls on the avenue
as a fus’ class chippie when she and I happened to
enter the theatre simultaneously. She had
clumped down the aisle before me, her open galoshes
swishing noisily, her two arms busy wriggling themselves
free from the torn sleeve lining of a shoddy
imitation fur coat that one of her mother’s wash
clients had sent to her. She was of medium height
and build, with overly developed legs and bust, and
had a clear, keen light brown complexion. Her too
slick, too naturally bobbed hair, mussed by the removing
of a tight, black turban was of an undecided
nature, i.e., it was undecided whether to be kinky
or to be kind, and her body, as she sauntered along
in the partial light had such a conscious sway of
invitation that unthinkingly I followed, slid into
the same row of seats and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>Naturally she had noticed my pursuit, and thinking
that I was eager to play the game, let me know
immediately that she was wise, and not the least bit
averse to spooning with me during the evening’s performance.
Interested, and, I might as well confess,
intrigued physically, I too became wise, and played
up to her with all the fervor, or so I thought, of an
old timer, but Cordelia soon remarked that I was
different from mos’ of des’ sheiks, and when pressed
for an explanation brazenly told me in a slightly
scandalized and patronizing tone that I had not
even felt her legs...!</p>

<p>At one o’clock in the morning we strolled through
the snowy bleakness of one hundred and forty-fourth
street between Lenox and Fifth Avenues to
the walk-up tenement flat in which she lived, and
after stamping the snow from our feet, pushed
through the double outside doors, and followed the
dismal hallway to the rear of the building where we
began the tedious climbing of the crooked, creaking,
inconveniently narrow stairway. Cordelia had informed
me earlier in the evening that she lived on
the top floor—four flights up east side rear—and
on our way we rested at each floor and at each half
way landing, rested long enough to mingle the snowy
dampness of our respective coats, and to hug clumsily
while our lips met in an animal kiss.</p>

<p>Finally only another half flight remained, and
instead of proceeding as was usual after our amourous
demonstration I abruptly drew away from her,
opened my overcoat, plunged my hand into my pants
pocket, and drew out two crumpled one dollar bills
which I handed to her, and then, while she stared
at me foolishly, I muttered good-night, confusedly
pecked her on her cold brown cheek, and darted
down into the creaking darkness.</p>

<p>Six months later I was taking two friends of
mine, lately from the provinces, to a Saturday night
house-rent party in a well known whore house
on one hundred and thirty-fourth street near
Lenox Avenue. The place as we entered seemed to
be a chaotic riot of raucous noise and clashing color
all rhythmically merging in the red, smoke filled
room. And there I saw Cordelia savagely careening
in a drunken abortion of the Charleston and
surrounded by a perspiring circle of handclapping
enthusiasts. Finally fatigued, she whirled into an
abrupt finish, and stopped so that she stared directly
into my face, but being dizzy from the calisthenic
turns and the cauterizing liquor she doubted
that her eyes recognized someone out of the past,
and, visibly trying to sober herself, languidly began
to dance a slow drag with a lean hipped pimply
faced yellow man who had walked between her and
me. At last he released her, and seeing that she was
about to leave the room I rushed forward calling
Cordelia?—as if I was not yet sure who it was.
Stopping in the doorway, she turned to see who had
called, and finally recognizing me said simply, without
the least trace of emotion—’Lo kid....</p>

<p>And without another word turned her back and
walked into the hall to where she joined four girls
standing there. Still eager to speak, I followed and
heard one of the girls ask: Who’s the dicty kid?...</p>

<p>And Cordelia answered: The guy who gimme ma’
firs’ two bucks....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span>—<i>Early night. The inside of a “Jim Crow” railway coach. The car
is parallel to the footlights. The seats on the down stage side of the coach are
omitted. There are the luggage racks above the seats. The windows are all
open. There are exits in each end of the car—right and left.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action.</span>—<i>Before the curtain goes up there is the sound of a locomotive whistle
and a stopping engine, loud laughter, many people speaking at once, good-natured
shrieks, strumming of stringed instruments, etc. The ascending curtain
discovers a happy lot of Negroes boarding the train dressed in the gaudy,
tawdry best of 1900. They are mostly in couples—each couple bearing a covered-over
market basket which the men hastily deposit in the racks as they scramble
for seats. There is a little friendly pushing and shoving. One pair just miss
a seat three times, much to the enjoyment of the crowd. Many “plug” silk hats
are in evidence, also sun-flowers in button holes. The women are showily
dressed in the manner of the time, and quite conscious of their finery. A
few seats remain unoccupied.</i></p>

of the Men</span> (<i>standing, lifting his “plug” in
a grand manner</i>). Howdy do, Miss Effie, you’se
lookin’ jes lak a rose.</p>

<p>(<i>Effie blushes and is confused. She looks up and
down for a seat.</i>) Fack is, if you wuzn’t walkin’
long, ah’d think you <i>wuz</i> a rose—(<i>he looks timidly
behind her and the others laugh</i>). Looka here,
where’s Sam at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie</span> (<i>tossing her head haughtily</i>). I don’t
know an’ I don’t keer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Man</span> (<i>visibly relieved</i>). Then lemme
scorch you to a seat. (<i>He takes her basket and leads
her to a seat center of the car, puts the basket in the
rack and seats himself beside her with his hat at a
rakish angle.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span> (<i>sliding his arm along the back of the
seat</i>). How come Sam ain’t heah—y’ll on a bust?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie</span> (<i>angrily</i>). A man dat don’t buy me
nothin tuh put in <i>mah</i> basket, ain’t goin’ wid <i>me</i> tuh
no cake walk. (<i>The hand on the seat touches her
shoulder and she thrusts it away</i>). Take yo’ arms
from ’round me, Dinky! Gwan hug yo’ Ada!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span> (<i>in mock indignation</i>). Do you think I’d
look at Ada when Ah got a chance tuh be wid you?
Ah always wuz sweet on you, but you let ole Mullet-head
Sam cut me out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another Man</span> (<i>with head out of the window</i>).
Just look at de darkies coming! (<i>With head inside
coach.</i>) Hey, Dinky! Heah come Ada wid a great
big basket.</p>

<p>(<i>Dinky jumps up from beside Effie and rushes to
exit right. In a moment they re-enter and take a
seat near entrance. Everyone in coach laughs.
Dinky’s girl turns and calls back to Effie.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> Where’s Sam, Effie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Lawd knows, Ada.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girl.</span> Lawd a mussy! Who you gointer walk

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Nobody, Ah reckon, John and Emma
gointer win it nohow. They’s the bestest cake walkers
in dis state.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ada.</span> You’se better than Emma any day in de
week. Cose Sam cain’t walk lake John. (<i>She
stands up and scans the coach.</i>) Looka heah, ain’t
John an’ Emma going? They ain’t on heah!</p>

<p>(<i>The locomotive bell begins to ring.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Mah Gawd, s’pose dey got left!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man</span> (<i>with head out of window</i>). Heah they
come, nip and tuck—whoo-ee! They’se gonna make
it! (<i>He waves excitedly.</i>) Come on Jawn! (<i>Everybody
crowds the windows, encouraging them by gesture
and calls. As the whistle blows twice, and
the train begins to move, they enter panting and
laughing at left. The only seat left is the one directly
in front of Effie.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dinky</span> (<i>standing</i>). Don’t y’all skeer us no mo’
lake dat! There couldn’t be no cake walk thout
y’all. Dem shad-mouf St. Augustine coons would
win dat cake and we would have tuh kill ’em all
bodaciously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> It was Emmaline nearly made us get
left. She says I wuz smiling at Effie on the street
car and she had to get off and wait for another one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>removing the hatpins from her hat, turns
furiously upon him</i>). You wuz grinning at her
and she wuz grinning back jes lake a ole chessy cat!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>positively</i>). I wuzn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>about to place her hat in rack</i>). You

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> I wuzn’t. I never gits a chance tuh smile
at nobody—you won’t let me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Jes the same every time you sees a yaller

silence for a minute.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dinky.</span> Ada, les we all sample de basket. I bet
you got huckleberry pie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ada.</span> No I aint, I got peach an’ tater pies, but

<p><span class="smcap">Dinky</span> (<i>mock alarm</i>). Naw, don’t do dat! It’s

<p><span class="smcap">Ada.</span> Aw shet up! (<i>He struggles with her for
a kiss. She slaps him but finally yields.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>looking behind him</i>). Hellow, Effie,
where’s Sam?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Deed, I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Y’all on a bust?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> None ah yo’ bizness, you got enough tuh
mind yo’ own self. Turn ’round!</p>

<p>(<i>She puts up a pouting mouth and he snatches a
kiss. She laughs just as he kisses her again and
there is a resounding smack which causes the crowd
to laugh. And cries of</i> “Oh you kid!” “Salty
dog!”)</p>

<p>(<i>Enter conductor left calling tickets cheerfully
and laughing at the general merriment.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conductor.</span> I hope somebody from Jacksonville
wins this cake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> You live in the “Big Jack?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conductor.</span> Sure do. And I wanta taste a
piece of that cake on the way back tonight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Jes rest easy—them Augustiners aint
gonna smell it. (<i>Turns to Emma.</i>) Is they, baby?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Not if Ah kin help it.</p>

<p><i>Somebody with a guitar sings</i>: “Ho babe, mah
honey taint no lie.”</p>

<p>(<i>The conductor takes up tickets, passes on and
exits right.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wesley.</span> Look heah, you cake walkers—y’all
oughter git up and limber up yo’ joints. I heard
them folks over to St. Augustine been oiling up wid
goose-grease, and over to Ocala they been rubbing
down in snake oil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Woman’s Voice.</span> You better shut up, Wesley,
you just joined de church last month. Somebody’s
going to tell the pastor on you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wesley.</span> Tell it, tell it, take it up and smell it.
Come on out you John and Emma and Effie, and
limber up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Naw, we don’t wanta do our walking
steps—-nobody won’t wanta see them when we step
out at the hall. But we kin do something else just
to warm ourselves up.</p>

<p>(<i>Wesley begins to play “Goo Goo Eyes” on his
accordion, the other instruments come in one by
one and John and Emma step into the aisle and
“parade” up and down the aisle—Emma holding up
her skirt, showing the lace on her petticoats. They
two-step back to their seat amid much applause.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wesley.</span> Come on out, Effie! Sam aint heah
so you got to hold up his side too. Step on out.
(<i>There is a murmur of applause as she steps into
the aisle. Wesley strikes up “I’m gointer live anyhow
till I die.” It is played quite spiritedly as Effie
swings into the pas-me-la</i>—)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wesley</span> (<i>in ecstasy</i>). Hot stuff I reckon! Hot
stuff I reckon! (<i>The musicians are stamping.
Great enthusiasm. Some clap time with hands and
feet. She hurls herself into a modified Hoochy
Koochy, and finishes up with an ecstatic yell.</i>)</p>

<p><i>There is a babble of talk and laughter and exultation.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>applauding loudly</i>). If dat Effie can’t
step nobody can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Course you’d say so cause it’s her.
Everything she do is pretty to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>caressing her</i>). Now don’t say that,
Honey. Dancing is dancing no matter who is doing
it. But nobody can hold a candle to you in nothing.</p>

<p>(<i>Some men are heard tuning up—getting pitch
to sing. Four of them crowd together in one seat
and begin the chorus of “Daisies Won’t Tell.”
John and Emma grow quite affectionate.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>kisses her</i>). Emma, what makes you always
picking a fuss with me over some yaller girl.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
What makes you so jealous, nohow? I don’t do
nothing.</p>

<p>(<i>She clings to him, but he turns slightly away.
The train whistle blows, there is a slackening of
speed. Passengers begin to take down baskets from
their racks.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> John! John, don’t you want me to
love you, honey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>turns and kisses her slowly</i>). Yes, I
want you to love me, you know I do. But I don’t
like to be accused o’ ever light colored girl in the
world. It hurts my feeling. I don’t want you to be
jealous like you are.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter at right Conductor, crying “St. Augustine,
St. Augustine.” He exits left. The crowd
has congregated at the two exits, pushing good-naturedly
and joking. All except John and Emma.
They are still seated with their arms about each
other.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>sadly</i>). Then you don’t want my love,
John, cause I can’t help mahself from being jealous.
I loves you so hard, John, and jealous love is the
only kind I got.</p>

<p>(<i>John kisses her very feelingly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Just for myself alone is the only way
I knows how to love.</p>

about each other as the curtain falls.</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Setting.</span>—<i>A weather-board hall. A large room with the joists bare. The
place has been divided by a curtain of sheets stretched on a rope across from
left to right. From behind the curtain there are occasional sounds of laughter,
a note or two on a stringed instrument or accordion. General stir. That is the
dance hall. The front is the ante-room where the refreshments are being served.
A “plank” seat runs all around the hall, along the walls. The lights are kerosene
lamps with reflectors. They are fixed to the wall. The lunch-baskets are
under the seat. There is a table on either side upstage with a woman behind
each. At one, ice cream is sold, at the other, roasted peanuts and large red-and-white
sticks of peppermint candy.</i></p>

<p><i>People come in by twos and threes, laughing, joking, horse-plays, gauchily
flowered dresses, small waists, bulging hips and busts, hats worn far back on
the head, etc. People from Ocala greet others from Palatka, Jacksonville, St.
Augustine, etc.</i></p>

<p><i>Some find seats in the ante-room, others pass on into the main hall.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter the Jacksonville delegation, laughing, pushing proudly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Let’s we git a seat, John, and set down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Sho will—nice one right over there.</p>

<p>(<i>They push over to wall seat, place basket underneath,
and sit. Newcomers shake hands with them
and urge them on to win.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Enter Joe Clarke and a small group. He is a
rotund, expansive man with a liberal watch chain
and charm.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dinky</span> (<i>slapping Clarke on the back</i>). If you
don’t go ’way from here! Lawdy, if it aint Joe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarke</span> (<i>jovially</i>). Ah thought you had done

Let’s we all eat first.</p>

<p>(<i>John and Emma go buy ice-cream. They coquettishly

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>smiles sheepishly</i>). You oughtn’t to

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Alright. (<i>He pulls the basket out and
she removes the table cloth. They set the basket
on their knees and begin to eat fried chicken.</i>)</p>

and Emma with two pieces of pie on a plate.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Effie.</span> Y’ll have a piece uh mah blueberry pie—it’s
mighty nice! (<i>She proffers it with a timid
smile to Emma who “freezes” up instantly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Naw! We don’t want no pie. We
got cocoanut layer-cake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Ah—Ah think ah’d choose a piece uh pie,

a snack wid us? (<i>He slides over to make room.</i>)</p>

mout’ want tuh taste mah pie. (<i>She turns to go.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Thank you, Effie. It’s mighty good, too.
(<i>He eats it. Effie crosses to her seat. Emma glares
at her for a minute, then turns disgustedly away
from the basket. John catches her shoulder and
faces her around.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>pleadingly</i>). Honey, be nice. Don’t act

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>jerking free</i>). Naw, you done ruint

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>looking around to see if they are overheard</i>).
Sh-sh! Honey, you mustn’t talk so loud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>louder</i>). Ah-Ah aint gonna bite mah

back is broad—(<i>John tries to cover her mouth with
his hand</i>). She calls herself a big cigar, but <i>I</i> kin
smoke her!</p>

<p>(<i>The people are laughing and talking for the
most part and pay no attention. Effie is laughing
and talking to those around her and does not hear
the tirade. The eating is over and everyone is going
behind the curtain. John and Emma put away
their basket like the others, and sit glum. Voice of
Master-of-ceremonies can be heard from beyond curtain
announcing the pas-me-la contest. The contestants,
mostly girls, take the floor. There is no
music except the clapping of hands and the shouts
of “Parse-me-lah” in time with the hand-clapping.
At the end Master announces winner. Shadows
seen on curtain.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Master.</span> Mathilda Clarke is winner—if she will
step forward she will receive a beautiful wook fascinator.
(<i>The girl goes up and receives it with
great hand-clapping and good humor.</i>) And now

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>amazed</i>). Why, Emma?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Cause, cause all them girls is going to
pulling and hauling on you, and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>impatiently</i>). Shucks! Come on. Don’t
you hear the people clapping for us and calling our
names? Come on!</p>

<p>(<i>He tries to pull her up—she tries to drag him
back.</i>)</p>

<p>Come on, Emma! Taint no sense in your acting
like this. The band is playing for us. Hear ’em?
(<i>He moves feet in a dance step.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Naw, John, Ah’m skeered. I loves you—I—.</p>

<p>(<i>He tries to break away from her. She is holding
on fiercely.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> I got to go! I been practising almost a
year—I—we done come all the way down here. I
can walk the cake, Emma—we got to—I got to
go in! (<i>He looks into her face and sees her tremendous
fear.</i>) What you skeered about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>hopefully</i>). You won’t go in—You’ll
come on go home with me all by ourselves. Come
on John. I can’t, I just can’t go in there and see
all them girls—Effie hanging after you—.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> I got to go in—(<i>he removes her hand
from his coat</i>)—whether you come with me or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Oh—them yaller wenches! How I hate
’em! They gets everything they wants—.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice Inside.</span> We are waiting for the couple
from Jacksonville—Jacksonville! Where is the
couple from—.</p>

<p>(<i>Wesley parts the curtain and looks out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wesley.</span> Here they is out here spooning! You
all can’t even hear your names called. Come on
John and Emma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Coming. (<i>He dashes inside. Wesley
stands looking at Emma in surprise.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wesley.</span> What’s the matter, Emma? You and
John spatting again? (<i>He goes back inside.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>calmly bitter</i>). He went and left me.
If we is spatting we done had our last one. (<i>She
stands and clenches her fists.</i>) Ah, mah God! He’s
in there with her—Oh, them half whites, they gets
everything, they gets everything everybody else
wants! The men, the jobs—everything! The whole
world is got a sign on it. Wanted: Light colored.
Us blacks was made for cobble stones. (<i>She muffles
a cry and sinks limp upon the seat.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice Inside.</span> Miss Effie Jones will walk for
Jacksonville with Mr. John Turner in place of
Miss Emmaline Beazeley.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Scene III</span>—<i>Dance Hall</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Emma springs to her feet and flings the curtains wide open. She stands
staring at the gay scene for a moment defiantly, then creeps over to a seat along
the wall and shrinks into the Spanish Moss, motionless.</i></p>

<p><i>Dance hall decorated with palmetto leaves and Spanish Moss—a flag or two.
Orchestra consists of guitar, mandolin, banjo, accordion, church organ and drum.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Master</span> (<i>on platform</i>). Couples take yo’ places!
When de music starts, gentlemen parade yo’ ladies
once round de hall, den de walk begins. (<i>The music
begins. Four men come out from behind the platform
bearing a huge chocolate cake. The couples
are “prancing” in their tracks. The men lead off
the procession with the cake—the contestants make
a grand slam around the hall.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Master.</span> Couples to de floor! Stan’ back,
ladies an’ gentlemen—give ’em plenty room.</p>

<p>(<i>Music changes to “Way Down in Georgia.”
Orchestra sings. Effie takes the arm that John offers
her and they parade to the other end of the hall.
She takes her place. John goes back upstage to the
platform, takes off his silk hat in a graceful sweep
as he bows deeply to Effie. She lifts her skirts and
curtsies to the floor. Both smile broadly. They
advance toward each other, meet midway, then, arm
in arm, begin to “strut.” John falters as he faces
her, but recovers promptly and is perfection in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
style. (Seven to nine minutes to curtain.) Fervor
of spectators grows until all are taking part in some
way—either hand-clapping or singing the words.
At curtain they have reached frenzy.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Quick Curtain</span></p>

<p>(<i>It stays down a few seconds to indicate ending
of contest and goes up again on John and Effie being
declared winners by Judges.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Master</span> (<i>on platform, with John and Effie on
the floor before him</i>). By unanimous decision de
cake goes to de couple from Jacksonville! (<i>Great
enthusiasm. The cake is set down in the center of
the floor and the winning couple parade around it
arm in arm. John and Effie circle the cake happily
and triumphantly. The other contestants, and then
the entire assembly fall in behind and circle the cake,
singing and clapping. The festivities continue. The
Jacksonville quartet step upon the platform and
sing a verse and chorus of “Daisies won’t tell.” Cries
of “Hurrah for Jacksonville! Glory for the big
town,” “Hurrah for Big Jack.”</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Man</span> (<i>seeing Emma</i>). You’re from Jacksonville,
aint you? (<i>He whirls her around and
around.</i>) Aint you happy? Whoopee! (<i>He releases
her and she drops upon a seat. She buries
her face in the moss.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Quartet begins on chorus again. People are departing,
laughing, humming, with quartet cheering.
John, the cake, and Effie being borne away in triumph.</i>)</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Scene IV</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>—<i>present. The interior of a one-room shack in an alley. There is a
small window in the rear wall upstage left. There is an enlarged crayon
drawing of a man and woman—man sitting cross-legged, woman standing with
her hand on his shoulder. A center table, red cover, a low, cheap rocker, two
straight chairs, a small kitchen stove at left with a wood-box beside it, a water-bucket
on a stand close by. A hand towel and a wash basin. A shelf of
dishes above this. There is an ordinary oil lamp on the center table but it is
not lighted when the curtain goes up. Some light enters through the window
and falls on the woman seated in the low rocker. The door is center right.
A cheap bed is against the upstage wall. Someone is on the bed but is lying
so that the back is toward the audience.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Action</span>—<i>As the curtain rises, the woman is seen rocking to and fro in the
low rocker. A dead silence except for the sound of the rocker and an occasional
groan from the bed. Once a faint voice says “water” and the woman in the
rocker arises and carries the tin dipper to the bed.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Woman.</span> No mo’ right away—Doctor says not
too much. (<i>Returns dipper to pail.—Pause.</i>) You
got right much fever—I better go git the doctor
agin.</p>

<p>(<i>There comes a knocking at the door and she
stands still for a moment, listening. It comes again
and she goes to door but does not open it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woman.</span> Who’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice Outside.</span> Does Emma Beasely live here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Yeah—(<i>pause</i>)—who is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice.</span> It’s me—John Turner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>puts hands eagerly on the fastening</i>).
John? Did you say John Turner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Voice.</span> Yes, Emma, it’s me.</p>

<p>(<i>The door is opened and the man steps inside.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> John! Your hand (<i>she feels for it and
touches it</i>). John flesh and blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>laughing awkwardly</i>). It’s me alright,
old girl. Just as bright as a basket of chips. Make
a light quick so I can see how you look. I’m crazy
to see you. Twenty years is a long time to wait,
Emma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>nervously</i>). Oh, let’s we all just sit in
the dark awhile. (<i>Apologetically.</i>) I wasn’t expecting
nobody and my house aint picked up. Sit
down. (<i>She draws up the chair. She sits in rocker.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Just to think! Emma! Me and Emma
sitting down side by each. Know how I found you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>dully</i>). Naw. How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>brightly</i>). Soon’s I got in town I hunted
up Wesley and he told me how to find you. That’s
who I come to see, you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Where you been all these years, up
North somewheres? Nobody round here could find
out where you got to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Yes, up North. Philadelphia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Married yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Oh yes, seventeen years ago. But my
wife is dead now and so I came as soon as it was decent
to find <i>you</i>. I wants to marry you. I couldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
die happy if I didn’t. Couldn’t get over you—couldn’t
forget. Forget me, Emma?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Naw, John. How could I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>leans over impulsively to catch her hand</i>).
Oh, Emma, I love you so much. Strike a light
honey so I can see you—see if you changed much.
You was such a handsome girl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> We don’t exactly need no light, do we,
John, tuh jus’ set an’ talk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Yes, we do, Honey. Gwan, make a
light. Ah wanna see you.</p>

<p>(<i>There is a silence.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Bet you’ wife wuz some high-yaller
dickty-doo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Naw she wasn’t neither. She was jus’
as much like you as Ah could get her. Make a
light an’ Ah’ll show you her pictcher. Shucks, ah
gotta look at mah old sweetheart. (<i>He strikes a
match and holds it up between their faces and they
look intently at each other over it until it burns out.</i>)
You aint changed none atall, Emma, jus’ as pretty
as a speckled pup yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>lighter</i>). Go long, John! (<i>Short pause</i>)
’member how you useter bring me magnolias?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Do I? Gee, you was sweet! ’Member
how Ah useter pull mah necktie loose so you could
tie it back for me? Emma, Ah can’t see to mah
soul how we lived all this time, way from one another.
’Member how you useter make out mah
ears had done run down and you useter screw ’em
up agin for me? (<i>They laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Yeah, Ah useter think you wuz gointer
be mah husban’ then—but you let dat ole—.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Ah aint gonna let you alibi on me lak
dat. Light dat lamp! You cain’t look me in de
eye and say no such. (<i>He strikes another match
and lights the lamp.</i>) Course, Ah don’t wanta look
too bossy, but Ah b’lieve you got to marry me tuh
git rid of me. That is, if you aint married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Naw, Ah aint. (<i>She turns the lamp
down.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>looking about the room</i>). Not so good,
Emma, But wait till you see dat little place in
Philly! Got a little “Rolls-Rough,” too—gointer
teach you to drive it, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Ah been havin’ a hard time, John, an’
Ah lost you—oh, aint nothin’ been right for me!
Ah aint never been happy.</p>

<p>(<i>John takes both of her hands in his.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> You gointer be happy now, Emma.
Cause Ah’m gointer make you. Gee Whiz! Ah
aint but forty-two and you aint forty yet—we got
plenty time. (<i>There is a groan from the bed.</i>) Gee,
what’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>ill at ease</i>). Thass mah chile. She’s
sick. Reckon Ah bettah see ’bout her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> You got a chile? Gee, that great! Ah
always wanted one, but didn’t have no luck. Now
we kin start off with a family. Girl or boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>slowly</i>). A girl. Comin’ tuh see me
agin soon, John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Comin’ agin? Ah aint gone yet! We
aint talked, you aint kissed me an’ nothin’, and you
aint showed me our girl. (<i>Another groan, more
prolonged.</i>) She must be pretty sick—let’s see.
(<i>He turns in his chair and Emma rushes over to
the bed and covers the girl securely, tucking her
long hair under the covers, too—before he arises.
He goes over to the bed and looks down into her
face. She is mulatto. Turns to Emma teasingly.</i>)
Talkin’ ’bout <i>me</i> liking high-yallers—<i>yo</i> husband
musta been pretty near <i>white</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>slowly</i>). Ah, never wuz married, John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> It’s alright, Emma. (<i>Kisses her warmly.</i>)
Everything is going to be O.K. (<i>Turning back to
the bed.</i>) Our child looks pretty sick, but she’s
pretty. (<i>Feels her forehead and cheek.</i>) Think she
oughter have a doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Ah done had one. Course Ah cain’t git
no specialist an’ nothin’ lak dat. (<i>She looks about
the room and his gaze follows hers.</i>) Ah aint got
a whole lot lake you. Nobody don’t git rich in
no white-folks’ kitchen, nor in de washtub. You
know Ah aint no school-teacher an’ nothin’ lak dat.</p>

<p>(<i>John puts his arm about her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> It’s all right, Emma. But our daughter
is bad off—run out an’ git a doctor—she needs one.
Ah’d go if Ah knowed where to find one—you kin
git one the quickest—hurry, Emma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>looks from John to her daughter and
back again.</i>) She’ll be all right, Ah reckon, for a
while. John, you love me—you really want me
sho’ nuff?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Sure Ah do—think Ah’d come all de way
down here for nothin’? Ah wants to marry agin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Soon, John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Real soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Ah wuz jus’ thinkin’, mah folks is away
now on a little trip—be home day after tomorrow—we
could git married tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> All right. Now run on after the doctor—we
must look after our girl. Gee, she’s got a full
suit of hair! Glad you didn’t let her chop it off.
(<i>Looks away from bed and sees Emma standing
still.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Emma, run on after the doctor, honey.
(<i>She goes to the bed and again tucks the long braids
of hair in, which are again pouring over the side of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the bed by the feverish tossing of the girl.</i>) What’s
our daughter’s name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Lou Lillian. (<i>She returns to the rocker
uneasily and sits rocking jerkily. He returns to his
seat and turns up the light.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Gee, we’re going to be happy—we gointer
make up for all them twenty years (<i>another groan</i>).
Emma, git up an’ gwan git dat doctor. You done
forgot Ah’m de boss uh dis family now—gwan,
while Ah’m here to watch her whilst you’re gone.
Ah got to git back to mah stoppin’-place after a
while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> You go git one, John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Whilst Ah’m blunderin’ round tryin’ to
find one, she’ll be gettin’ worse. She sounds pretty
bad—(<i>takes out his wallet and hands her a bill</i>)—get
a taxi if necessary. Hurry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>does not take the money, but tucks her
arms and hair in again, and gives the girl a drink</i>).
Reckon Ah better go git a doctor. Don’t want
nothin’ to happen to <i>her</i>. After you left, Ah useter
have such a hurtin’ in heah (<i>touches bosom</i>) till she
come an’ eased it some.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Here, take some money and get a good
doctor. There must be some good colored ones
around here now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>scornfully</i>). I wouldn’t let one of ’em
tend my cat if I had one! But let’s we don’t start
a fuss.</p>

<p>(<i>John caresses her again. When he raises his
head he notices the picture on the wall and crosses
over to it with her—his arm still about her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Why, that’s you and me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Yes, I never could part with that. You
coming tomorrow morning, John, and we’re gointer
get married, aint we? Then we can talk over
everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Sure, but I aint gone yet. I don’t see
how come we can’t make all our arrangements now.</p>

<p>(<i>Groans from bed and feeble movement.</i>)</p>

<p>Good lord, Emma, go get that doctor!</p>

<p>(<i>Emma stares at the girl and the bed and seizes
a hat from a nail on the wall. She prepares to go
but looks from John to bed and back again. She
fumbles about the table and lowers the lamp. Goes
to door and opens it. John offers the wallet. She
refuses it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> Doctor right around the corner. Guess
I’ll leave the door open so she can get some air.
She won’t need nothing while I’m gone, John. (<i>She
crosses and tucks the girl in securely and rushes out,
looking backward and pushing the door wide open
as she exits. John sits in the chair beside the table.
Looks about him—shakes his head. The girl on
the bed groans</i>, “water,” “so hot.” <i>John looks about
him excitedly. Gives her a drink. Feels her forehead.
Takes a clean handkerchief from his pocket
and wets it and places it upon her forehead. She
raises her hand to the cool object. Enter Emma running.
When she sees John at the bed she is full of
fury. She rushes over and jerks his shoulder around.
They face each other.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma.</span> I knowed it! (<i>She strikes him.</i>) A half
white skin. (<i>She rushes at him again. John staggers
back and catches her hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Emma!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>struggles to free her hands</i>). Let me go
so I can kill you. Come sneaking in here like a
pole cat!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>slowly, after a long pause</i>). So this is
the woman I’ve been wearing over my heart like a
rose for twenty years! She so despises her own skin
that she can’t believe any one else could love it!</p>

<p>(<i>Emma writhes to free herself.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Twenty years! Twenty years of adoration,
of hunger, of worship! (<i>On the verge of
tears he crosses to door and exits quietly, closing
the door after him.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Emma remains standing, looking dully about as
if she is half asleep. There comes a knocking at
the door. She rushes to open it. It is the doctor.
White. She does not step aside so that he can enter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Well, shall I come in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>stepping aside and laughing a little</i>).
That’s right, doctor, come in.</p>

<p>(<i>Doctor crosses to bed with professional air.
Looks at the girl, feels the pulse and draws up the
sheet over the face. He turns to her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Why didn’t you come sooner. I told
you to let me know of the least change in her condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>flatly</i>). I did come—I went for the
doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Doctor.</span> Yes, but you waited. An hour more
or less is mighty important sometimes. Why didn’t
you come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma</span> (<i>passes hand over face</i>). Couldn’t see.</p>

<p>(<i>Doctor looks at her curiously, then sympathetically
takes out a small box of pills, and hands them
to her.</i>) Here, you’re worn out. Take one of these
every hour and try to get some sleep. (<i>He departs.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>She puts the pill-box on the table, takes up the
low rocking chair and places it by the head of the
bed. She seats herself and rocks monotonously and
stares out of the door. A dry sob now and then.
The wind from the open door blows out the lamp
and she is seen by the little light from the window
rocking in an even, monotonous gait, and sobbing.</i>)</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>His name</i> was Paul Watson and as he shambled
down rue Pigalle he might have been
any other Negro of enormous height and size.
But as I have said, his name was Paul Watson.
Passing him on the street, you might not have
known or cared who he was, but any one of the
residents about the great Montmartre district of
Paris could have told you who he was as well as
many interesting bits of his personal history.</p>

<p>He had come to Paris in the days before colored
jazz bands were the style. Back home he had been
a prize fighter. In the days when Joe Gans was in
his glory Paul was following the ring, too. He
didn’t have that fine way about him that Gans had
and for that reason luck seemed to go against him.
When he was in the ring he was like a mad bull,
especially if his opponent was a white man. In
those days there wasn’t any sympathy or nicety
about the ring and so pretty soon all the ringmasters
got down on Paul and he found it pretty
hard to get a bout with anyone. Then it was that
he worked his way across the Atlantic Ocean on a
big liner—in the days before colored jazz bands
were the style in Paris.</p>

<p>Things flowed along smoothly for the first few
years with Paul’s working here and there in the
unfrequented places of Paris. On the side he
used to give boxing lessons to aspiring youths or
gymnastic young women. At that time he was
working so steadily that he had little chance to find
out what was going on around Paris. Pretty soon,
however, he grew to be known among the trainers
and managers began to fix up bouts for him. After
one or two successful bouts a little fame began to
come into being for him. So it was that after
one of the prize-fights, a colored fellow came to his
dressing room to congratulate him on his success as
well as invite him to go to Montmartre to meet
“the boys.”</p>

<p>Paul had a way about him and seemed to get on
with the colored fellows who lived in Montmartre
and when the first Negro jazz band played
in a tiny Parisian cafe Paul was among them
playing the banjo. Those first years were
without event so far as Paul was concerned. The
members of that first band often say now that they
wonder how it was that nothing happened during
those first seven years, for it was generally known
how great was Paul’s hatred for American white
people. I suppose the tranquility in the light of
what happened afterwards was due to the fact that
the cafe in which they worked was one in which
mostly French people drank and danced and then
too, that was before there were so many Americans
visiting Paris. However, everyone had heard Paul
speak of his intense hatred of American white folks.
It only took two Benedictines to make him start
talking about what he would do to the first “Yank”
that called him “nigger.” But the seven years came
to an end and Paul Watson went to work in a
larger cafe with a larger band, patronized almost
solely by Americans.</p>

<p>I’ve heard almost every Negro in Montmartre
tell about the night that a drunken Kentuckian came
into the cafe where Paul was playing and said:</p>

<p>“Look heah, Bruther, what you all doin’ ovah
heah?”</p>

<p>“None ya bizness. And looka here, I ain’t your
brother, see?”</p>

<p>“Jack, do you heah that nigger talkin’ lak that tah
me?”</p>

<p>As he said this, he turned to speak to his companion.
I have often wished that I had been there
to have seen the thing happen myself. Every tale
I have heard about it was different and yet there
was something of truth in each of them. Perhaps
the nearest one can come to the truth is by saying
that Paul beat up about four full-sized white men
that night besides doing a great deal of damage to
the furniture about the cafe. I couldn’t tell you
just what did happen. Some of the fellows say
that Paul seized the nearest table and mowed down
men right and left, others say he took a bottle, then
again the story runs that a chair was the instrument
of his fury. At any rate, that started Paul Watson
on his siege against the American white person who
brings his native prejudices into the life of Paris.</p>

<p>It is a verity that Paul was the “black terror.”
The last syllable of the word, nigger, never passed
the lips of a white man without the quick reflex action
of Paul’s arm and fist to the speaker’s jaw.
He paid for more glassware and cafe furnishings in
the course of the next few years than is easily imaginable.
And yet, there was something likable
about Paul. Perhaps that’s the reason that he stood
in so well with the policemen of the neighborhood.
Always some divine power seemed to intervene in
his behalf and he was excused after the payment of
a small fine with advice about his future conduct.
Finally, there came the night when in a frenzy he
shot the two American sailors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>They had not died from the wounds he had
given them hence his sentence had not been one of
death but rather a long term of imprisonment. It
was a pitiable sight to see Paul sitting in the corner
of his cell with his great body hunched almost
double. He seldom talked and when he did his
words were interspersed with oaths about the lowness
of “crackers.” Then the World War came.</p>

<p>It seems strange that anything so horrible as that
wholesale slaughter could bring about any good
and yet there was something of a smoothing quality
about even its baseness. There has never been such
equality before or since such as that which the
World War brought. Rich men fought by the side
of paupers; poets swapped yarns with dry-goods
salesmen, while Jews and Christians ate corned
beef out of the same tin. Along with the general
leveling influence came France’s pardon of her prisoners
in order that they might enter the army.
Paul Watson became free and a French soldier.
Because he was strong and had innate daring in his
heart he was placed in the aerial squad and cited
many times for bravery. The close of the war
gave him his place in French society as a hero. With
only a memory of the war and an ugly scar on his
left cheek he took up his old life.</p>

<p>His firm resolutions about American white people
still remained intact and many chance encounters
that followed the war are told from lip to lip
proving that the war and his previous imprisonment
had changed him little. He was the same Paul
Watson to Montmartre as he shambled up rue
Pigalle.</p>

<p>Rue Pigalle in the early evening has a sombre
beauty—gray as are most Paris streets and other-worldish.
To those who know the district it is the
Harlem of Paris and rue Pigalle is its dusky Seventh
Avenue. Most of the colored musicians that furnish
Parisians and their visitors with entertainment
live somewhere in the neighborhood of rue Pigalle.
Some time during every day each of these musicians
makes a point of passing through rue Pigalle. Little
wonder that almost any day will find Paul Watson
going his shuffling way up the same street.</p>

<p>He reached the corner of rue de la Bruyere and
with sure instinct his feet stopped. Without half
thinking he turned into “the Pit.” Its full name
is The Flea Pit. If you should ask one of the
musicians why it was so called, he would answer
you to the effect that it was called “the pit” because
all the “fleas” hang out there. If you did not get
the full import of this explanation, he would go
further and say that there were always “spades”
in the pit and they were as thick as fleas. Unless
you could understand this latter attempt at clarity
you could not fully grasp what the Flea-Pit means
to the Negro musicians in Montmartre. It is a tiny
cafe of the genus that is called <i>bistro</i> in France.
Here the fiddle players, saxophone blowers, drum-beaters
and ivory ticklers gather at four in the afternoon
for a porto or a game of billiards. Here the
cabaret entertainers and supper musicians meet at
one o’clock at night or thereafter for a whiskey and
soda, or more billiards. Occasional sandwiches and
a “quiet game” also play their parts in the popularity
of the place. After a season or two it becomes a
settled fact just what time you may catch so-and-so
at the famous “Pit.”</p>

<p>The musicians were very fond of Paul and took
particular delight in teasing him. He was one of
the chosen few that all of the musicians conceded
as being “regular.” It was the pet joke of the
habitues of the cafe that Paul never bothered with
girls. They always said that he could beat up ten
men but was scared to death of one woman.</p>

<p>“Say fellow, when ya goin’ a get hooked up?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say, Bo. Ain’t so much on skirts.”</p>

<p>“Man alive, ya don’t know what you’re missin’—somebody
little and cute telling ya sweet things in
your ear. Paris is full of women folks.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t much on ’em all the same. Then too,
they’re all white.”</p>

<p>“What’s it to ya? This ain’t America.”</p>

<p>“Can’t help that. Get this—I’m collud, see? I
ain’t got nothing for no white meat to do. If a
woman eva called me nigger I’d have to kill her,
that’s all!”</p>

<p>“You for it, son. I can’t give you a thing on this
Mr. Jefferson Lawd way of lookin’ at women.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tain’t that. I guess they’re all right for
those that wants ’em. Not me!”</p>

<p>“Oh you ain’t so forty. You’ll fall like all the
other spades I’ve ever seen. Your kind falls hardest.”</p>

<p>And so Paul went his way—alone. He smoked
and drank with the fellows and sat for hours in
the Montmartre cafes and never knew the companionship
of a woman. Then one night after his
work he was walking along the street in his queer
shuffling way when a woman stepped up to his side.</p>

<p>“Voulez vous.”</p>

<p>“Naw, gowan away from here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you speak English, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“You an ’merican woman?”</p>

<p>“Used to be ’fore I went on the stage and got
stranded over here.”</p>

<p>“Well, get away from here. I don’t like your
kind!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“Aw, Buddy, don’t say that. I ain’t prejudiced
like some fool women.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know who I am, do you? I’m Paul
Watson and I hate American white folks, see?”</p>

<p>He pushed her aside and went on walking alone.
He hadn’t gone far when she caught up to him and
said with sobs in her voice:—</p>

<p>“Oh, Lordy, please don’t hate me ’cause I was
born white and an American. I ain’t got a sou to
my name and all the men pass me by cause I ain’t
spruced up. Now you come along and won’t look
at me cause I’m white.”</p>

<p>Paul strode along with her clinging to his arm.
He tried to shake her off several times but there was
no use. She clung all the more desperately to him.
He looked down at her frail body shaken with sobs,
and something caught at his heart. Before he knew
what he was doing he had said:—</p>

<p>“Naw, I ain’t that mean. I’ll get you some grub.
Quit your cryin’. Don’t like seein’ women folks
cry.”</p>

<p>It was the talk of Montmartre. Paul Watson
takes a woman to Gavarnni’s every night for dinner.
He comes to the Flea Pit less frequently, thus giving
the other musicians plenty of opportunity to discuss
him.</p>

<p>“How times do change. Paul, the woman-hater,
has a Jane now.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t said nothing, fella. That ain’t all.
She’s white and an ’merican, too.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way with these spades. They beat
up all the white men they can lay their hands on
but as soon as a gang of golden hair with blue eyes
rubs up close to them they forget all they ever said
about hatin’ white folks.”</p>

<p>“Guess he thinks that skirt’s gone on him. Dumb
fool!”</p>

<p>“Don’ be no chineeman. That old gag don’ fit
for Paul. He cain’t understand it no more’n we
can. Says he jess can’t help himself, everytime she
looks up into his eyes and asks him does he love her.
They sure are happy together. Paul’s goin’ to
marry her, too. At first she kept saying that she
didn’t want to get married cause she wasn’t the
marrying kind and all that talk. Paul jus’ laid
down the law to her and told her he never would
live with no woman without being married to her.
Then she began to tell him all about her past life.
He told her he didn’t care nothing about what she
used to be jus’ so long as they loved each other now.
Guess they’ll make it.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, Paul told me the same tale last night. He’s
sure gone on her all right.”</p>

<p>“They’re gettin’ tied up next Sunday. So glad
it’s not me. Don’t trust these American dames. Me
for the Frenchies.”</p>

<p>“She ain’t so worse for looks, Bud. Now that he’s
been furnishing the green for the rags.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but I don’t see no reason for the wedding
bells. She was right—she ain’t the marrying kind.”</p>

<p>... and so Montmartre talked. In every cafe
where the Negro musicians congregated Paul Watson
was the topic for conversation. He had suddenly
fallen from his place as bronze God to almost
less than the dust.</p>

<p>The morning sun made queer patterns on Paul’s
sleeping face. He grimaced several times in his
slumber, then finally half-opened his eyes. After a
succession of dream-laden blinks he gave a great
yawn, and rubbing his eyes, looked at the open window
through which the sun shone brightly. His
first conscious thought was that this was the bride’s
day and that bright sunshine prophesied happiness
for the bride throughout her married life. His
first impulse was to settle back into the covers and
think drowsily about Mary and the queer twists
life brings about, as is the wont of most bridegrooms
on their last morning of bachelorhood. He
put this impulse aside in favor of dressing quickly
and rushing downstairs to telephone to Mary to
say “happy wedding day” to her.</p>

<p>One huge foot slipped into a worn bedroom slipper
and then the other dragged painfully out of the
warm bed were the courageous beginnings of his
bridal toilette. With a look of triumph he put on
his new grey suit that he had ordered from an English
tailor. He carefully pulled a taffeta tie into
place beneath his chin, noting as he looked at his
face in the mirror that the scar he had received in
the army was very ugly—funny, marrying an ugly
man like him.</p>

<p>French telephones are such human faults. After
trying for about fifteen minutes to get Central 32.01
he decided that he might as well walk around to
Mary’s hotel to give his greeting as to stand there in
the lobby of his own, wasting his time. He debated
this in his mind a great deal. They were to be married
at four o’clock. It was eleven now and it did
seem a shame not to let her have a minute or two by
herself. As he went walking down the street towards
her hotel he laughed to think of how one always
cogitates over doing something and finally does
the thing he wanted to in the beginning anyway.</p>

<p>Mud on his nice gray suit that the English tailor
had made for him. Damn—gray suit—what did he
have a gray suit on for, anyway. Folks with black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
faces shouldn’t wear gray suits. Gawd, but it was
funny that time when he beat up that cracker at the
Periquet. Fool couldn’t shut his mouth he was so
surprised. Crackers—damn ’em—he was one nigger
that wasn’t ’fraid of ’em. Wouldn’t he have a
hell of a time if he went back to America where
black was black. Wasn’t white nowhere, black
wasn’t. What was that thought he was trying to
get ahold of—bumping around in his head—something
he started to think about but couldn’t remember
it somehow.</p>

<p>The shrill whistle that is typical of the French
subway pierced its way into his thoughts. Subway—why
was he in the subway—he didn’t want to go
any place. He heard doors slamming and saw the
blue uniforms of the conductors swinging on to the
cars as the trains began to pull out of the station.
With one or two strides he reached the last coach
as it began to move up the platform. A bit out of
breath he stood inside the train and looking down at
what he had in his hand he saw that it was a tiny
pink ticket. A first class ticket in a second class
coach. The idea set him to laughing. Everyone
in the car turned and eyed him, but that did not
bother him. Wonder what stop he’d get off—funny
how these French said descend when they meant get
off—funny he couldn’t pick up French—been here
so long. First class ticket in a second class coach!—that
was one on him. Wedding day today, and
that damn letter from Mary. How’d she say it
now, “just couldn’t go through with it,” white
women just don’t marry colored men, and she was
a street woman, too. Why couldn’t she have told
him flat that she was just getting back on her feet
at his expense. Funny that first class ticket he
bought, wish he could see Mary—him a-going there
to wish her “happy wedding day,” too. Wonder
what that French woman was looking at him so
hard for? Guess it was the mud.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>He wanted to do something</i> ... to write or
draw ... or something ... but it was so
comfortable just to lay there on the bed ...
... his shoes off ... and think ... think of everything
... short disconnected thoughts—to wonder
... to remember ... to think and smoke ... why
wasn’t he worried that he had no money ... he <i>had</i>
had five cents ... but he had been hungry ... he
<i>was</i> hungry and still ... all he wanted to do was
... lay there comfortably smoking ... think ...
wishing he were writing ... or drawing ... or
something ... something about the things he felt
and thought ... but what did he think ... he remembered
how his mother had awakened him one
night ... ages ago ... six years ago ... Alex ... he
had always wondered at the strangeness of it ...
she had seemed so ... so ... so just the same ...
Alex ... I think your father is dead ... and it hadn’t
seemed so strange ... yet ... one’s mother didn’t
say that ... didn’t wake one at midnight every night
to say ... feel him ... put your hand on his head
... then whisper with a catch in her voice ... I’m
afraid ... sh don’t wake Lam ... yet it hadn’t
seemed as it should have seemed ... even when he
had felt his father’s cool wet forehead ... it hadn’t
been tragic ... the light had been turned very low
... and flickered ... yet it hadn’t been tragic ... or
weird ... not at all as one should feel when one’s
father died ... even his reply of ... yes he is dead
... had been commonplace ... hadn’t been dramatic
... there had been no tears ... no sobs ... not even
a sorrow ... and yet he must have realized that
one’s father couldn’t smile ... or sing any more ...
after he had died ... every one remembered his
father’s voice ... it had been a lush voice ... a
promise ... then that dressing together ... his
mother and himself ... in the bathroom ... why
was the bathroom always the warmest room in the
winter ... as they had put on their clothes ... his
mother had been telling him what he must do ...
and cried softly ... and that had made him cry too
but you mustn’t cry Alex ... remember you have to
be a little man now ... and that was all ... didn’t
other wives and sons cry more for their dead than
that ... anyway people never cried for beautiful
sunsets ... or music ... and those were the things
that hurt ... the things to sympathize with ... then
out into the snow and dark of the morning ... first
to the undertaker’s ... no first to Uncle Frank’s
... why did Aunt Lula have to act like that ...
to ask again and again ... but when did he die ...
when did he die ... I just can’t believe it ... poor
Minerva ... then out into the snow and dark again
... how had his mother expected him to know where
to find the night bell at the undertaker’s ... he was
the most sensible of them all tho ... all he had said
was ... what ... Harry Francis ... too bad ...
tell mamma I’ll be there first thing in the morning
... then down the deserted streets again ... to
grandmother’s ... it was growing light now ... it
must be terrible to die in daylight ... grandpa had
been sweeping the snow off the yard ... he had been
glad of that because ... well he could tell him better
than grandma ... grandpa ... father’s dead ...
and he hadn’t acted strange either ... books lied ...
he had just looked at Alex a moment then continued
sweeping ... all he said was ... what time did he
die ... she’ll want to know ... then passing thru
the lonesome street toward home ... Mrs. Mamie
Grant was closing a window and spied him ...
hallow Alex ... an’ how’s your father this mornin’
... dead ... get out ... tch tch tch an’ I was just
around there with a cup a’ custard yesterday ...
Alex puffed contentedly on his cigarette ... he was
hungry and comfortable ... and he had an ivory
holder inlaid with red jade and green ... funny
how the smoke seemed to climb up that ray of sunlight
... went up the slant just like imagination ...
was imagination blue ... or was it because he had
spent his last five cents and couldn’t worry ... anyway
it was nice to lay there and wonder ... and
remember ... why was he so different from other
people ... the only things he remembered of his
father’s funeral were the crowded church and the
ride in the hack ... so many people there in the
church ... and ladies with tears in their eyes ...
and on their cheeks ... and some men too ... why
did people cry ... vanity that was all ... yet they
weren’t exactly hypocrites ... but why ... it had
made him furious ... all these people crying ...
it wasn’t <i>their</i> father ... and he wasn’t crying ...
couldn’t cry for sorrow altho he had loved his father
more than ... than ... it had made him so angry
that tears had come to his eyes ... and he had been
ashamed of his mother ... crying into a handkerchief
... so ashamed that tears had run down his
cheeks and he had frowned ... and some one ...
a woman ... had said ... look at that poor little
dear ... Alex is just like his father ... and the
tears had run fast ... because he <i>wasn’t</i> like his
father ... he couldn’t sing ... he didn’t want to
sing ... he didn’t want to sing ... Alex blew a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
cloud of smoke ... blue smoke ... when they had
taken his father from the vault three weeks later ...
he had grown beautiful ... his nose had become
perfect and clear ... his hair had turned jet black
and glossy and silky ... and his skin was a transparent
green ... like the sea only not so deep ...
and where it was drawn over the cheek bones a pale
beautiful red appeared ... like a blush ... why
hadn’t his father looked like that always ... but
no ... to have sung would have broken the wondrous
repose of his lips and maybe that was his
beauty ... maybe it was wrong to think thoughts
like these ... but they were nice and pleasant and
comfortable ... when one was smoking a cigarette
thru an ivory holder ... inlaid with red jade and
green....</p>

<p>he wondered why he couldn’t find work ... a
job ... when he had first come to New York he
had ... and he had only been fourteen then was it
because he was nineteen now that he felt so idle ...
and contented ... or because he was an artist ...
but was he an artist ... was one an artist until one
became known ... of course he was an artist ...
and strangely enough so were all his friends ... he
should be ashamed that he didn’t work ... but ...
was it five years in New York ... or the fact that
he was an artist ... when his mother said she
couldn’t understand him ... why did he vaguely
pity her instead of being ashamed ... he should be
... his mother and all his relatives said so ... his
brother was three years younger than he and yet
he had already been away from home a year ... on
the stage ... making thirty-five dollars a week ...
had three suits and many clothes and was going to
help mother ... while he ... Alex ... was content
to lay and smoke and meet friends at night ... to
argue and read Wilde ... Freud ... Boccacio and
Schnitzler ... to attend Gurdjieff meetings and
know things ... Why did they scoff at him for
knowing such people as Carl ... Mencken ...
Toomer ... Hughes ... Cullen ... Wood ...
Cabell ... oh the whole lot of them ... was it because
it seemed incongruous that he ... who was
so little known ... should call by first names people
they would like to know ... were they jealous ...
no mothers aren’t jealous of their sons ... they are
proud of them ... why then ... when these friends
accepted and liked him ... no matter how he dressed
... why did mother ask ... and you went looking
like that ... Langston was a fine fellow ... he
knew there was something in Alex ... and so did
Rene and Borgia ... and Zora and Clement and
Miguel ... and ... and ... and all of them ... if
he went to see mother she would ask ... how do you
feel Alex with nothing in your pockets ... I don’t
see how you can be satisfied ... Really you’re a
mystery to me ... and who you take after ... I’m
sure I don’t know ... none of my brothers were
lazy and shiftless ... I can never remember the
time when they weren’t sending money home and
your father was your age he was supporting a
family ... where you get your nerve I don’t know
... just because you’ve tried to write one or two
little poems and stories that no one understands ...
you seem to think the world owes you a living ...
you should see by now how much is thought of them
... you can’t sell anything ... and you won’t do
anything to make money ... wake up Alex ... I
don’t know what will become of you....</p>

<p>it was hard to believe in one’s self after that ...
did Wildes’ parents or Shelly’s or Goya’s talk to
them like that ... but it was depressing to think in
that vein ... Alex stretched and yawned ... Max
had died ... Margaret had died ... so had Sonia ...
Cynthia ... Juan-Jose and Harry ... all people
he had loved ... loved one by one and together ...
and all had died ... he never loved a person long
before they died ... in truth he was tragic ... that
was a lovely appellation ... The Tragic Genius ...
think ... to go thru life known as The Tragic
Genius ... romantic ... but it was more or less
true ... Alex turned over and blew another cloud
of smoke ... was all life like that ... smoke ...
blue smoke from an ivory holder ... he wished he
were in New Bedford ... New Bedford was a nice
place ... snug little houses set complacently behind
protecting lawns ... half open windows showing
prim interiors from behind waving cool curtains ...
inviting ... like precise courtesans winking from
behind lace fans ... and trees ... many trees ...
casting lacey patterns of shade on the sun dipped
sidewalks ... small stores ... naively proud of their
pseudo grandeur ... banks ... called institutions
for saving ... all naive ... that was it ... New
Bedford was naive ... after the sophistication of
New York it would fan one like a refreshing breeze
... and yet he had returned to New York ... and
sophistication ... was he sophisticated ... no because
he was seldom bored ... seldom bored by anything
... and weren’t the sophisticated continually
suffering from ennui ... on the contrary ... he was
amused ... amused by the artificiality of naivety
and sophistication alike ... but may be that in itself
was the essence of sophistication or ... was it cynicism
... or were the two identical ... he blew a
cloud of smoke ... it was growing dark now ...
and the smoke no longer had a ladder to climb ...
but soon the moon would rise and then he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
clothe the silver moon in blue smoke garments ...
truly smoke was like imagination....</p>

<p>Alex sat up ... pulled on his shoes and went out
... it was a beautiful night ... and so large ... the
dusky blue hung like a curtain in an immense arched
doorway ... fastened with silver tacks ... to wander
in the night was wonderful ... myriads of inquisitive
lights ... curiously prying into the dark
... and fading unsatisfied ... he passed a woman
... she was not beautiful ... and he was sad because
she did not weep that she would never be beautiful
... was it Wilde who had said ... a cigarette is
the most perfect pleasure because it leaves one unsatisfied
... the breeze gave to him a perfume stolen
from some wandering lady of the evening ... it
pleased him ... why was it that men wouldn’t use
perfumes ... they should ... each and every one of
them liked perfumes ... the man who denied that
was a liar ... or a coward ... but if ever he were
to voice that thought ... express it ... he would be
misunderstood ... a fine feeling that ... to be misunderstood
... it made him feel tragic and great
... but may be it would be nicer to be understood
... but no ... no great artist is ... then again
neither were fools ... they were strangely akin
these two ... Alex thought of a sketch he would
make ... a personality sketch of Fania ... straight
classic features tinted proud purple ... sensuous
fine lips ... gilded for truth ... eyes ... half
opened and lids colored mysterious green ... hair
black and straight ... drawn sternly mocking back
from the false puritanical forehead ... maybe he
would made Edith too ... skin a blue ... infinite
like night ... and eyes ... slant and grey ... very
complacent like a cat’s ... Mona Lisa lips ... red
and seductive as ... as pomegranate juice ... in
truth it was fine to be young and hungry and an
artist ... to blow blue smoke from an ivory holder....</p>

<p>here was the cafeteria ... it was almost as tho it
had journeyed to meet him ... the night was so
blue ... how does blue feel ... or red or gold or
any other color ... if colors could be heard he could
paint most wondrous tunes ... symphonious ...
think ... the dulcet clear tone of a blue like night
... of a red like pomegranate juice ... like Edith’s
lips ... of the fairy tones to be heard in a sunset
... like rubies shaken in a crystal cup ... of the
symphony of Fania ... and silver ... and gold ...
he had heard the sound of gold ... but they weren’t
the sounds he wanted to catch ... no ... they must
be liquid ... not so staccato but flowing variations
of the same caliber ... there was no one in the
cafe as yet ... he sat and waited ... that was a
clever idea he had had about color music ... but
after all he was a monstrous clever fellow ...
Jurgen had said that ... funny how characters in
books said the things one wanted to say ... he
would like to know Jurgen ... how does one go
about getting an introduction to a fiction character
... go up to the brown cover of the book and knock
gently ... and say hello ... then timidly ... is
Duke Jurgen there ... or ... no because if entered
the book in the beginning Jurgen would only be a
pawn broker ... and one didn’t enter a book in the
center ... but what foolishness ... Alex lit a cigarette
... but Cabell was a master to have written
Jurgen ... and an artist ... and a poet ... Alex
blew a cloud of smoke ... a few lines of one of
Langston’s poems came to describe Jurgen....</p>

<p>Langston must have known Jurgen ... suppose
Jurgen had met Tonio Kroeger ... what a vagrant
thought ... Kroeger ... Kroeger ... Kroeger ...
why here was Rene ... Alex had almost gone to
sleep ... Alex blew a cone of smoke as he took
Rene’s hand ... it was nice to have friends like Rene
... so comfortable ... Rene was speaking ...
Borgia joined them ... and de Diego Padro ...
their talk veered to ... James Branch Cabell ...
beautiful ... marvelous ... Rene had an enchanting
accent ... said sank for thank and souse for south
... but they couldn’t know Cabell’s greatness ...
Alex searched the smoke for expression ... he ...
he ... well he has created a phantasy mire ... that’s
it ... from clear rich imagery ... life and silver
sands ... that’s nice ... and silver sands ...
imagine lilies growing in such a mire ... when they
close at night their gilded underside would protect
... but that’s not it at all ... his thoughts just
carried and mingled like ... like odors ... suggested
but never definite ... Rene was leaving ...
they all were leaving ... Alex sauntered slowly
back ... the houses all looked sleepy ... funny
... made him feel like writing poetry ... and about
death too ... an elevated crashed by overhead scattering
all his thoughts with its noise ... making
them spread ... in circles ... then larger circles
... just like a splash in a calm pool ... what had
he been thinking ... of ... a poem about death ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
but he no longer felt that urge ... just walk and
think and wonder ... think and remember and
smoke ... blow smoke that mixed with his thoughts
and the night ... he would like to live in a large
white palace ... to wear a long black cape ... very
full and lined with vermillion ... to have many
cushions and to lie there among them ... talking to
his friends ... lie there in a yellow silk shirt and
black velvet trousers ... like music-review artists
talking and pouring strange liquors from curiously
beautiful bottles ... bottles with long slender necks
... he climbed the noisy stair of the odorous tenement
... smelled of fish ... of stale fried fish and
dirty milk bottles ... he rather liked it ... he liked
the acrid smell of horse manure too ... strong ...
thoughts ... yes to lie back among strangely fashioned
cushions and sip eastern wines and talk ...
Alex threw himself on the bed ... removed his
shoes ... stretched and relaxed ... yes and have
music waft softly into the darkened and incensed
room ... he blew a cloud of smoke ... oh the joy
of being an artist and of blowing blue smoke thru
an ivory holder inlaid with red jade and green....</p>

<p>the street was so long and narrow ... so long
and narrow ... and blue ... in the distance it
reached the stars ... and if he walked long enough
... far enough ... he could reach the stars too ...
the narrow blue was so empty ... quiet ... Alex
walked music ... it was nice to walk in the blue
after a party ... Zora had shone again ... her
stories ... she always shone ... and Monty was
glad ... every one was glad when Zora shone ...
he was glad he had gone to Monty’s party ...
Monty had a nice place in the village ... nice lights
... and friends and wine ... mother would
be scandalized that he could think of going to a
party ... without a copper to his name ... but then
mother had never been to Monty’s ... and mother
had never seen the street seem long and narrow
and blue ... Alex walked music ... the click of
his heels kept time with a tune in his mind ... he
glanced into a lighted cafe window ... inside were
people sipping coffee ... men ... why did they sit
there in the loud light ... didn’t they know that
outside the street ... the narrow blue street met
the stars ... that if they walked long enough ...
far enough ... Alex walked and the click of his
heels sounded ... and had an echo ... sound being
tossed back and forth ... back and forth ... some
one was approaching ... and their echoes mingled
... and gave the sound of castanets ... Alex liked
the sound of the approaching man’s footsteps ...
he walked music also ... he knew the beauty of the
narrow blue ... Alex knew that by the way their
echoes mingled ... he wished he would speak ...
but strangers don’t speak at four o’clock in the
morning ... at least if they did he couldn’t imagine
what would be said ... maybe ... pardon me but
are you walking toward the stars ... yes, sir, and if
you walk long enough ... then may I walk with
you I want to reach the stars too ... perdone me
senor tiene vd. fosforo ... Alex was glad he had
been addressed in Spanish ... to have been asked
for a match in English ... or to have been addressed
in English at all ... would have been blasphemy
just then ... Alex handed him a match ... he
glanced at his companion apprehensively in the
match glow ... he was afraid that his appearance
would shatter the blue thoughts ... and stars ...
ah ... his face was a perfect compliment to his voice
... and the echo of their steps mingled ... they
walked in silence ... the castanets of their heels
clicking accompaniment ... the stranger inhaled
deeply and with a nod of content and a smile ...
blew a cloud of smoke ... Alex felt like singing ...
the stranger knew the magic of blue smoke also ...
they continued in silence ... the castanets of their
heels clicking rhythmically ... Alex turned in his
doorway ... up the stairs and the stranger waited
for him to light the room ... no need for words
... they had always known each other ...
as they undressed by the blue dawn ... Alex knew
he had never seen a more perfect being ... his body
was all symmetry and music ... and Alex called
him Beauty ... long they lay ... blowing smoke
and exchanging thoughts ... and Alex swallowed
with difficulty ... he felt a glow of tremor ... and
they talked and ... slept....</p>

<p>Alex wondered more and more why he liked
Adrian so ... he liked many people ...
Wallie ... Zora ... Clement ... Gloria
... Langston ... John ... Gwenny ... oh many
people ... and they were friends ... but Beauty
... it was different ... once Alex had admired
Beauty’s strength ... and Beauty’s eyes had grown
soft and he had said ... I like you more than any
one Dulce ... Adrian always called him Dulce ...
and Alex had become confused ... was it that he
was so susceptible to beauty that Alex liked Adrian
so much ... but no ... he knew other people who
were beautiful ... Fania and Gloria ... Monty and
Bunny ... but he was never confused before them
... while Beauty ... Beauty could make him believe
in Buddha ... or imps ... and no one else
could do that ... that is no one but Melva ... but
then he was in love with Melva ... and that explained
that ... he would like Beauty to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Melva ... they were both so perfect ... such compliments
... yes he would like Beauty to know
Melva because he loved them both ... there ... he
had thought it ... actually dared to think it ...
but Beauty must never know ... Beauty couldn’t
understand ... indeed Alex couldn’t understand ...
and it pained him ... almost physically ... and
tired his mind ... Beauty ... Beauty was in the air
... the smoke ... Beauty ... Melva ... Beauty
... Melva ... Alex slept ... and dreamed....</p>

<p>he was in a field ... a field of blue smoke and
black poppies and red calla lilies ... he was searching
... on his hands and knees ... searching ... among
black poppies and red calla lilies ... he was searching
pushed aside poppy stems ... and saw two strong
white legs ... dancer’s legs ... the contours pleased
him ... his eyes wandered ... on past the muscular
hocks to the firm white thighs ... the rounded
buttocks ... then the lithe narrow waist ... strong
torso and broad deep chest ... the heavy shoulders
... the graceful muscled neck ... squared chin and
quizzical lips ... grecian nose with its temperamental
nostrils ... the brown eyes looking at him
... like ... Monty looked at Zora ... his hair
curly and black and all tousled ... and it was
Beauty ... and Beauty smiled and looked at him
and smiled ... said ... I’ll wait Alex ... and Alex
became confused and continued his search ... on his
hands and knees ... pushing aside poppy stems and
lily stems ... a poppy ... a black poppy ... a lily
... a red lily ... and when he looked back he could
no longer see Beauty ... Alex continued his search
... thru poppies ... lilies ... poppies and red calla
lilies ... and suddenly he saw ... two small feet
olive-ivory ... two well turned legs curving gracefully
from slender ankles ... and the contours
soothed him ... he followed them ... past the narrow
rounded hips to the tiny waist ... the fragile
firm breasts ... the graceful slender throat ... the
soft rounded chin ... slightly parting lips and
straight little nose with its slightly flaring nostrils
... the black eyes with lights in them ... looking
at him ... the forehead and straight cut black hair
... and it was Melva ... and she looked at him and
smiled and said ... I’ll wait Alex ... and Alex
became confused and kissed her ... became confused
and continued his search ... on his hands and knees
... pushed aside a poppy stem ... a black-poppy
stem ... pushed aside a lily stem ... a red-lily stem
... a poppy ... a poppy ... a lily ... and suddenly
he stood erect ... exultant ... and in his hand he
held ... an ivory holder ... inlaid with red jade
... and green....</p>

<p>and Alex awoke ... Beauty’s hair tickled his nose
... Beauty was smiling in his sleep ... half his face
stained flush color by the sun ... the other half in
shadow ... blue shadow ... his eye lashes casting
cobwebby blue shadows on his cheek ... his lips
were so beautiful ... quizzical ... Alex wondered
why he always thought of that passage from Wilde’s
Salome ... when he looked at Beauty’s lips ... I
would kiss your lips ... he <i>would</i> like to kiss
Beauty’s lips ... Alex flushed warm ... with shame
... or was it shame ... he reached across Beauty
for a cigarette ... Beauty’s cheek felt cool to his
arm ... his hair felt soft ... Alex lay smoking ...
such a dream ... red calla lilies ... red calla lilies
... and ... what could it all mean ... did dreams
have meanings ... Fania said ... and black poppies
... thousands ... millions ... Beauty stirred ...
Alex put out his cigarette ... closed his eyes ... he
mustn’t see Beauty yet ... speak to him ... his lips
were too hot ... dry ... the palms of his hands too
cool and moist ... thru his half closed eyes he could
see Beauty ... propped ... cheek in hand ... on
one elbow ... looking at him ... lips smiling
quizzically ... he wished Beauty wouldn’t look so
hard ... Alex was finding it difficult to breathe
... breathe normally ... why <i>must</i> Beauty look so
long ... and smile <i>that</i> way ... his face seemed
nearer ... it was ... Alex could feel Beauty’s hair
on his forehead ... breathe normally ... breathe
normally ... could feel Beauty’s breath on his nostrils
and lips ... and it was clean and faintly colored
with tobacco ... breathe normally Alex ...
Beauty’s lips were nearer ... Alex closed his eyes
... how did one act ... his pulse was hammering
... from wrists to finger tip ... wrist to finger tip
... Beauty’s lips touched his ... his temples
throbbed ... throbbed ... his pulse hammered from
wrist to finger tip ... Beauty’s breath came short
now ... softly staccato ... breathe normally Alex
... you are asleep ... Beauty’s lips touched his ...
breathe normally ... and pressed ... pressed hard
... cool ... his body trembled ... breathe normally
Alex ... Beauty’s lips pressed cool ... cool and
hard ... how much pressure does it take to waken
one ... Alex sighed ... moved softly ... how does
one act ... Beauty’s hair barely touched him now
... his breath was faint on ... Alex’s nostrils ...
and lips ... Alex stretched and opened his eyes ...
Beauty was looking at him ... propped on one elbow
... cheek in his palm ... Beauty spoke ...
scratch my head please Dulce ... Alex was breathing
normally now ... propped against the bed head
... Beauty’s head in his lap ... Beauty spoke ... I
wonder why I like to look at some things Dulce ...
things like smoke and cats ... and you ... Alex’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
pulse no longer hammered from ... wrist to finger
tip ... wrist to finger tip ... the rose dusk had become
blue night ... and soon ... soon they would
go out into the blue....</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>It was eleven o’clock</i> of a Spring night in Florida.
It was Sunday. Any other night, Delia Jones
would have been in bed for two hours by this
time. But she was a washwoman, and Monday
morning meant a great deal to her. So she collected
the soiled clothes on Saturday when she returned
the clean things. Sunday night after church,
she sorted them and put the white things to soak.
It saved her almost a half day’s start. A great hamper
in the bedroom held the clothes that she brought
home. It was so much neater than a number of
bundles lying around.</p>

<p>She squatted in the kitchen floor beside the great
pile of clothes, sorting them into small heaps according
to color, and humming a song in a mournful
key, but wondering through it all where Sykes,
her husband, had gone with her horse and buckboard.</p>

<p>Just then something long, round, limp and black
fell upon her shoulders and slithered to the floor
beside her. A great terror took hold of her. It
softened her knees and dried her mouth so that it
was a full minute before she could cry out or move.
Then she saw that it was the big bull whip her husband
liked to carry when he drove.</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes to the door and saw him standing
there bent over with laughter at her fright.
She screamed at him.</p>

<p>“Sykes, what you throw dat whip on me like
dat? You know it would skeer me—looks just like
a snake, an’ you knows how skeered Ah is of snakes.”</p>

<p>“Course Ah knowed it! That’s how come Ah
done it.” He slapped his leg with his hand and
almost rolled on the ground in his mirth. “If you
such a big fool dat you got to have a fit over a
earth worm or a string, Ah don’t keer how bad Ah
skeer you.”</p>

<p>“You aint got no business doing it. Gawd knows
it’s a sin. Some day Ah’m gointuh drop dead from
some of yo’ foolishness. ’Nother thing, where you
been wid mah rig? Ah feeds dat pony. He aint
fuh you to be drivin’ wid no bull whip.”</p>

<p>“You sho is one aggravatin’ nigger woman!” he
declared and stepped into the room. She resumed
her work and did not answer him at once. “Ah
done tole you time and again to keep them white
folks’ clothes outa dis house.”</p>

<p>He picked up the whip and glared down at her.
Delia went on with her work. She went out into
the yard and returned with a galvanized tub and
sit it on the washbench. She saw that Sykes had
kicked all of the clothes together again, and now
stood in her way truculently, his whole manner hoping,
<i>praying</i>, for an argument. But she walked
calmly around him and commenced to re-sort the
things.</p>

<p>“Next time, Ah’m gointer kick ’em outdoors,”
he threatened as he struck a match along the leg
of his corduroy breeches.</p>

<p>Delia never looked up from her work, and her
thin, stooped shoulders sagged further.</p>

<p>“Ah aint for no fuss t’night Sykes. Ah just
come from taking sacrament at the church house.”</p>

<p>He snorted scornfully. “Yeah, you just come
from de church house on a Sunday night, but heah
you is gone to work on them clothes. You ain’t
nothing but a hypocrite. One of them amen-corner
Christians—sing, whoop, and shout, then come home
and wash white folks clothes on the Sabbath.”</p>

<p>He stepped roughly upon the whitest pile of
things, kicking them helter-skelter as he crossed the
room. His wife gave a little scream of dismay,
and quickly gathered them together again.</p>

<p>“Sykes, you quit grindin’ dirt into these clothes!
How can Ah git through by Sat’day if Ah don’t
start on Sunday?”</p>

<p>“Ah don’t keer if you never git through. Anyhow,
Ah done promised Gawd and a couple of other
men, Ah aint gointer have it in mah house. Don’t
gimme no lip neither, else Ah’ll throw ’em out
and put mah fist up side yo’ head to boot.”</p>

<p>Delia’s habitual meekness seemed to slip from
her shoulders like a blown scarf. She was on her
feet; her poor little body, her bare knuckly hands
bravely defying the strapping hulk before her.</p>

<p>“Looka heah, Sykes, you done gone too fur. Ah
been married to you fur fifteen years, and Ah been
takin’ in washin’ fur fifteen years. Sweat, sweat,
sweat! Work and sweat, cry and sweat, pray and
sweat!”</p>

<p>“What’s that got to do with me?” he asked brutally.</p>

<p>“What’s it got to do with you, Sykes? Mah tub
of suds is filled yo’ belly with vittles more times
than yo’ hands is filled it. Mah sweat is done paid
for this house and Ah reckon Ah kin keep on sweatin’
in it.”</p>

<p>She seized the iron skillet from the stove and
struck a defensive pose, which act surprised him
greatly, coming from her. It cowed him and he
did not strike her as he usually did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“Naw you won’t,” she panted, “that ole snaggle-toothed
black woman you runnin’ with aint comin’
heah to pile up on <i>mah</i> sweat and blood. You aint
paid for nothin’ on this place, and Ah’m gointer
stay right heah till Ah’m toted out foot foremost.”</p>

<p>“Well, you better quit gittin’ me riled up, else
they’ll be totin’ you out sooner than you expect.
Ah’m so tired of you Ah don’t know whut to do.
Gawd! how Ah hates skinny wimmen!”</p>

<p>A little awed by this new Delia, he sidled out of
the door and slammed the back gate after him. He
did not say where he had gone, but she knew too
well. She knew very well that he would not return
until nearly daybreak also. Her work over, she
went on to bed but not to sleep at once. Things
had come to a pretty pass!</p>

<p>She lay awake, gazing upon the debris that cluttered
their matrimonial trail. Not an image left
standing along the way. Anything like flowers had
long ago been drowned in the salty stream that had
been pressed from her heart. Her tears, her sweat,
her blood. She had brought love to the union and he
had brought a longing after the flesh. Two months
after the wedding, he had given her the first brutal
beating. She had the memory of his numerous trips
to Orlando with all of his wages when he had returned
to her penniless, even before the first year
had passed. She was young and soft then, but
now she thought of her knotty, muscled limbs, her
harsh knuckly hands, and drew herself up into an
unhappy little ball in the middle of the big feather
bed. Too late now to hope for love, even if it
were not Bertha it would be someone else. This
case differed from the others only in that she was
bolder than the others. Too late for everything except
her little home. She had built it for her old days,
and planted one by one the trees and flowers there.
It was lovely to her, lovely.</p>

<p>Somehow, before sleep came, she found herself
saying aloud: “Oh well, whatever goes over the
Devil’s back, is got to come under his belly. Sometime
or ruther, Sykes, like everybody else, is gointer
reap his sowing.” After that she was able to build
a spiritual earthworks against her husband. His
shells could no longer reach her. <i>Amen.</i> She went
to sleep and slept until he announced his presence
in bed by kicking her feet and rudely snatching the
cover away.</p>

<p>“Gimme some kivah heah, an’ git yo’ damn foots
over on yo’ own side! Ah oughter mash you in yo’
mouf fuh drawing dat skillet on me.”</p>

<p>Delia went clear to the rail without answering
him. A triumphant indifference to all that he was
or did.</p>

<p>The week was as full of work for Delia as all
other weeks, and Saturday found her behind her
little pony, collecting and delivering clothes.</p>

<p>It was a hot, hot day near the end of July. The
village men on Joe Clarke’s porch even chewed cane
listlessly. They did not hurl the cane-knots as
usual. They let them dribble over the edge of the
porch. Even conversation had collapsed under the
heat.</p>

<p>“Heah come Delia Jones,” Jim Merchant said,
as the shaggy pony came ’round the bend of the
road toward them. The rusty buckboard was heaped
with baskets of crisp, clean laundry.</p>

<p>“Yep,” Joe Lindsay agreed. “Hot or col’, rain
or shine, jes ez reg’lar ez de weeks roll roun’ Delia
carries ’em an’ fetches ’em on Sat’day.”</p>

<p>“She better if she wanter eat,” said Moss. “Syke
Jones aint wuth de shot an’ powder hit would tek
tuh kill ’em. Not to <i>huh</i> he aint.”</p>

<p>“He sho’ aint,” Walter Thomas chimed in.
“It’s too bad, too, cause she wuz a right pritty lil
trick when he got huh. Ah’d uh mah’ied huh mahseff
if he hadnter beat me to it.”</p>

<p>Delia nodded briefly at the men as she drove past.</p>

<p>“Too much knockin’ will ruin <i>any</i> ’oman. He
done beat huh ’nough tuh kill three women, let ’lone
change they looks,” said Elijah Mosely. “How
Syke kin stommuck dat big black greasy Mogul he’s
layin’ roun’ wid, gits me. Ah swear dat eight-rock
couldn’t kiss a sardine can Ah done thowed out de
back do’ ’way las’ yeah.”</p>

<p>“Aw, she’s fat, thass how come. He’s allus been
crazy ’bout fat women,” put in Merchant. “He’d
a’ been tied up wid one long time ago if he could a’
found one tuh have him. Did Ah tell yuh ’bout
him come sidlin’ roun’ <i>mah</i> wife—bringin’ her a
basket uh pee-cans outa his yard fuh a present? Yessir,
mah wife! She tol’ him tuh take ’em right
straight back home, cause Delia works so hard ovah
dat washtub she reckon everything on de place taste
lak sweat an’ soapsuds. Ah jus’ wisht Ah’d a’
caught ’im ’roun’ dere! Ah’d a’ made his hips
ketch on fiah down dat shell road.”</p>

<p>“Ah know he done it, too. Ah sees ’im grinnin’
at every ’oman dat passes,” Walter Thomas said.
“But even so, he useter eat some mighty big hunks
uh humble pie tuh git dat lil’ ’oman he got. She
wuz ez pritty ez a speckled pup! Dat wuz fifteen
yeahs ago. He useter be so skeered uh losin’ huh,
she could make him do some parts of a husband’s
duty. Dey never wuz de same in de mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“There oughter be a law about him,” said Lindsay.
“He aint fit tuh carry guts tuh a bear.”</p>

<p>Clarke spoke for the first time. “Taint no law
on earth dat kin make a man be decent if it aint in
’im. There’s plenty men dat takes a wife lak dey
do a joint uh sugar-cane. It’s round, juicy an’ sweet
when dey gits it. But dey squeeze an’ grind, squeeze
an’ grind an’ wring tell dey wring every drop uh
pleasure dat’s in ’em out. When dey’s satisfied dat
dey is wrung dry, dey treats ’em jes lak dey do a
cane-chew. Dey throws ’em away. Dey knows
whut dey is doin’ while dey is at it, an’ hates theirselves
fuh it but they keeps on hangin’ after huh
tell she’s empty. Den dey hates huh fuh bein’ a cane-chew
an’ in de way.”</p>

<p>“We oughter take Syke an’ dat stray ’oman uh
his’n down in Lake Howell swamp an’ lay on de
rawhide till they cain’t say ‘Lawd a’ mussy.’ He
allus wuz uh ovahbearin’ niggah, but since dat white
’oman from up north done teached ’im how to run
a automobile, he done got too biggety to live—an’
we oughter kill ’im,” Old Man Anderson advised.</p>

<p>A grunt of approval went around the porch. But
the heat was melting their civic virtue and Elijah
Moseley began to bait Joe Clarke.</p>

<p>“Come on, Joe, git a melon outa dere an’ slice
it up for yo’ customers. We’se all sufferin’ wid
de heat. De bear’s done got <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“Thass right, Joe, a watermelon is jes’ whut Ah
needs tuh cure de eppizudicks,” Walter Thomas
joined forces with Moseley. “Come on dere, Joe.
We all is steady customers an’ you aint set us up
in a long time. Ah chooses dat long, bowlegged
Floridy favorite.”</p>

<p>“A god, an’ be dough. You all gimme twenty
cents and slice away,” Clarke retorted. “Ah needs
a col’ slice m’self. Heah, everybody chip in. Ah’ll
lend y’ll mah meat knife.”</p>

<p>The money was quickly subscribed and the huge
melon brought forth. At that moment, Sykes and
Bertha arrived. A determined silence fell on the
porch and the melon was put away again.</p>

<p>Merchant snapped down the blade of his jack-knife
and moved toward the store door.</p>

<p>“Come on in, Joe, an’ gimme a slab uh sow belly
an’ uh pound uh coffee—almost fuhgot ’twas Sat’day.
Got to git on home.” Most of the men left
also.</p>

<p>Just then Delia drove past on her way home, as
Sykes was ordering magnificently for Bertha. It
pleased him for Delia to see.</p>

<p>“Git whutsoever yo’ heart desires, Honey. Wait
a minute, Joe. Give huh two bottles uh strawberry
soda-water, uh quart uh parched ground-peas, an’
a block uh chewin’ gum.”</p>

<p>With all this they left the store, with Sykes reminding
Bertha that this was his town and she
could have it if she wanted it.</p>

<p>The men returned soon after they left, and held
their watermelon feast.</p>

<p>“Where did Syke Jones git dat ’oman from no-how?”
Lindsay asked.</p>

<p>“Ovah Apopka. Guess dey musta been cleanin’
out de town when she lef’. She don’t look lak a
thing but a hunk uh liver wid hair on it.”</p>

<p>“Well, she sho’ kin squall,” Dave Carter contributed.
“When she gits ready tuh laff, she jes’
opens huh mouf an’ latches it back tuh de las’ notch.
No ole grandpa alligator down in Lake Bell ain’t got
nothin’ on huh.”</p>

<p>Bertha had been in town three months now.
Sykes was still paying her room rent at Della Lewis’—the
only house in town that would have taken her
in. Sykes took her frequently to Winter Park to
“stomps.” He still assured her that he was the
swellest man in the state.</p>

<p>“Sho’ you kin have dat lil’ ole house soon’s Ah
kin git dat ’oman outa dere. Everything b’longs
tuh me an’ you sho’ kin have it. Ah sho’ ’bominates
uh skinny ’oman. Lawdy, you sho’ is got one portly
shape on you! You kin git <i>anything</i> you wants.
Dis is <i>mah</i> town an’ you sho’ kin have it.”</p>

<p>Delia’s work-worn knees crawled over the earth
in Gethsemane and up the rocks of Calvary many,
many times during these months. She avoided the
villagers and meeting places in her efforts to be blind
and deaf. But Bertha nullified this to a degree,
by coming to Delia’s house to call Sykes out to her
at the gate.</p>

<p>Delia and Sykes fought all the time now with no
peaceful interludes. They slept and ate in silence.
Two or three times Delia had attempted a timid
friendliness, but she was repulsed each time. It was
plain that the breaches must remain agape.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_smallbreak_10" style="width: 5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_smallbreak.png" alt="">

<p>The sun had burned July to August. The heat
streamed down like a million hot arrows, smiting
all things living upon the earth. Grass withered,
leaves browned, snakes went blind in shedding and
men and dogs went mad. Dog days!</p>

<p>Delia came home one day and found Sykes there
before her. She wondered, but started to go on
into the house without speaking, even though he
was standing in the kitchen door and she must either
stoop under his arm or ask him to move. He made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
no room for her. She noticed a soap box beside the
steps, but paid no particular attention to it, knowing
that he must have brought it there. As she was
stooping to pass under his outstretched arm, he suddenly
pushed her backward, laughingly.</p>

<p>“Look in de box dere Delia, Ah done brung yuh
somethin’!”</p>

<p>She nearly fell upon the box in her stumbling, and
when she saw what it held, she all but fainted outright.</p>

<p>“Syke! Syke, mah Gawd! You take dat rattlesnake
’way from heah! You <i>gottuh</i>. Oh, Jesus,
have mussy!”</p>

<p>“Ah aint gut tuh do nuthin’ uh de kin’—fact is
Ah aint got tuh do nothin’ but die. Taint no use
uh you puttin’ on airs makin’ out lak you skeered
uh dat snake—he’s gointer stay right heah tell he
die. He wouldn’t bite me cause Ah knows how tuh
handle ’im. Nohow he wouldn’t risk breakin’ out
his fangs ’gin <i>yo’</i> skinny laigs.”</p>

<p>“Naw, now Syke, don’t keep dat thing ’roun’
heah tuh skeer me tuh death. You knows Ah’m
even feared uh earth worms. Thass de biggest snake
Ah evah did see. Kill ’im Syke, please.”</p>

<p>“Doan ast me tuh do nothin’ fuh yuh. Goin
’roun’ tryin’ tuh be so damn asterperious. Naw, Ah
aint gonna kill it. Ah think uh damn sight mo’ uh
him dan you! Dat’s a nice snake an’ anybody doan
lak ’im kin jes’ hit de grit.”</p>

<p>The village soon heard that Sykes had the snake,
and came to see and ask questions.</p>

<p>“How de hen-fire did you ketch dat six-foot rattler,
Syke?” Thomas asked.</p>

<p>“He’s full uh frogs so he caint hardly move, thass
how Ah eased up on ’m. But Ah’m a snake charmer
an’ knows how tuh handle ’em. Shux, dat aint
nothin’. Ah could ketch one eve’y day if Ah so
wanted tuh.”</p>

<p>“Whut he needs is a heavy hick’ry club leaned
real heavy on his head. Dat’s de bes ’way tuh
charm a rattlesnake.”</p>

<p>“Naw, Walt, y’ll jes’ don’t understand dese diamon’
backs lak Ah do,” said Sykes in a superior tone
of voice.</p>

<p>The village agreed with Walter, but the snake
stayed on. His box remained by the kitchen door
with its screen wire covering. Two or three days
later it had digested its meal of frogs and literally
came to life. It rattled at every movement in the
kitchen or the yard. One day as Delia came down
the kitchen steps she saw his chalky-white fangs
curved like scimitars hung in the wire meshes. This
time she did not run away with averted eyes as
usual. She stood for a long time in the doorway in
a red fury that grew bloodier for every second that
she regarded the creature that was her torment.</p>

<p>That night she broached the subject as soon as
Sykes sat down to the table.</p>

<p>“Syke, Ah wants you tuh take dat snake ’way
fum heah. You done starved me an’ Ah put up
widcher, you done beat me an Ah took dat, but
you done kilt all mah insides bringin’ dat varmint
heah.”</p>

<p>Sykes poured out a saucer full of coffee and drank
it deliberately before he answered her.</p>

<p>“A whole lot Ah keer ’bout how you feels inside
uh out. Dat snake aint goin’ no damn wheah till
Ah gits ready fuh ’im tuh go. So fur as beatin’ is
concerned, yuh aint took near all dat you gointer
take ef yuh stay ’roun’ <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>Delia pushed back her plate and got up from the
table. “Ah hates you, Sykes,” she said calmly. “Ah
hates you tuh de same degree dat Ah useter love
yuh. Ah done took an’ took till mah belly is full
up tuh mah neck. Dat’s de reason Ah got mah
letter fum de church an’ moved mah membership
tuh Woodbridge—so Ah don’t haftuh take no sacrament
wid yuh. Ah don’t wantuh see yuh ’roun’ me
atall. Lay ’roun’ wid dat ’oman all yuh wants tuh,
but gwan ’way fum me an’ mah house. Ah hates
yuh lak uh suck-egg dog.”</p>

<p>Sykes almost let the huge wad of corn bread and
collard greens he was chewing fall out of his mouth
in amazement. He had a hard time whipping himself
up to the proper fury to try to answer Delia.</p>

<p>“Well, Ah’m glad you does hate me. Ah’m sho’
tiahed uh you hangin’ ontuh me. Ah don’t want
yuh. Look at yuh stringey ole neck! Yo’ rawbony
laigs an’ arms is enough tuh cut uh man tuh death.
You looks jes’ lak de devvul’s doll-baby tuh <i>me</i>.
You cain’t hate me no worse dan Ah hates you. Ah
been hatin’ <i>you</i> fuh years.”</p>

<p>“Yo’ ole black hide don’t look lak nothin’ tuh
me, but uh passle uh wrinkled up rubber, wid yo’
big ole yeahs flappin’ on each side lak up paih uh
buzzard wings. Don’t think Ah’m gointuh be run
’way fum mah house neither. Ah’m goin’ tuh de
white folks bout <i>you</i>, mah young man, de very nex’
time you lay yo’ han’s on me. Mah cup is done run
ovah.” Delia said this with no signs of fear and
Sykes departed from the house, threatening her, but
made not the slightest move to carry out any of
them.</p>

<p>That night he did not return at all, and the next
day being Sunday, Delia was glad that she did not
have to quarrel before she hitched up her pony and
drove the four miles to Woodbridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>She stayed to the night service—“love feast”—which
was very warm and full of spirit. In the
emotional winds her domestic trials were borne far
and wide so that she sang as she drove homeward,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Jurden water, black an’ col’</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Chills de body, not de soul</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>An’ Ah wantah cross Jurden in uh calm time.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She came from the barn to the kitchen door and
stopped.</p>

<p>“Whut’s de mattah, ol’ satan, you aint kickin’ up
yo’ racket?” She addressed the snake’s box. Complete
silence. She went on into the house with a
new hope in its birth struggles. Perhaps her threat
to go to the white folks had frightened Sykes!
Perhaps he was sorry! Fifteen years of misery and
suppression had brought Delia to the place where
she would hope <i>anything</i> that looked towards a way
over or through her wall of inhibitions.</p>

<p>She felt in the match safe behind the stove at
once for a match. There was only one there.</p>

<p>“Dat niggah wouldn’t fetch nothin’ heah tuh
save his rotten neck, but he kin run threw whut Ah
brings quick enough. Now he done toted off nigh
on tuh haff uh box uh matches. He done had dat
’oman heah in mah house, too.”</p>

<p>Nobody but a woman could tell how she knew
this even before she struck the match. But she did
and it put her into a new fury.</p>

<p>Presently she brought in the tubs to put the white
things to soak. This time she decided she need not
bring the hamper out of the bedroom; she would
go in there and do the sorting. She picked up the
pot-bellied lamp and went in. The room was small
and the hamper stood hard by the foot of the white
iron bed. She could sit and reach through the
bedposts—resting as she worked.</p>

<p>“Ah wantah cross Jurden in uh calm time.” She
was singing again. The mood of the “love feast”
had returned. She threw back the lid of the basket
almost gaily. Then, moved by both horror and terror,
she spring back toward the door. <i>There lay the
snake in the basket!</i> He moved sluggishly at first,
but even as she turned round and round, jumped up
and down in an insanity of fear, he began to stir
vigorously. She saw him pouring his awful beauty
from the basket upon the bed, then she seized the
lamp and ran as fast as she could to the kitchen.
The wind from the open door blew out the light
and the darkness added to her terror. She sped to
the darkness of the yard, slamming the door after
her before she thought to set down the lamp. She
did not feel safe even on the ground, so she climbed
up in the hay barn.</p>

<p>There for an hour or more she lay sprawled upon
the hay a gibbering wreck.</p>

<p>Finally she grew quiet, and after that, coherent
thought. With this, stalked through her a cold,
bloody rage. Hours of this. A period of introspection,
a space of retrospection, then a mixture of
both. Out of this an awful calm.</p>

<p>“Well, Ah done de bes’ Ah could. If things
aint right, Gawd knows taint mah fault.”</p>

<p>She went to sleep—a twitchy sleep—and woke up
to a faint gray sky. There was a loud hollow sound
below. She peered out. Sykes was at the wood-pile,
demolishing a wire-covered box.</p>

<p>He hurried to the kitchen door, but hung outside
there some minutes before he entered, and stood
some minutes more inside before he closed it after
him.</p>

<p>The gray in the sky was spreading. Delia descended
without fear now, and crouched beneath the
low bedroom window. The drawn shade shut out
the dawn, shut in the night. But the thin walls
held back no sound.</p>

<p>“Dat ol’ scratch is woke up now!” She mused at
the tremendous whirr inside, which every woodsman
knows, is one of the sound illusions. The rattler
is a ventriloquist. His whirr sounds to the
right, to the left, straight ahead, behind, close under
foot—everywhere but where it is. Woe to him
who guesses wrong unless he is prepared to hold up
his end of the argument! Sometimes he strikes
without rattling at all.</p>

<p>Inside, Sykes heard nothing until he knocked a
pot lid off the stove while trying to reach the match
safe in the dark. He had emptied his pockets at
Bertha’s.</p>

<p>The snake seemed to wake up under the stove and
Sykes made a quick leap into the bedroom. In spite
of the gin he had had, his head was clearing now.</p>

<p>“Mah Gawd!” he chattered, “ef Ah could on’y
strack uh light!”</p>

<p>The rattling ceased for a moment as he stood
paralyzed. He waited. It seemed that the snake
waited also.</p>

<p>“Oh, fuh de light! Ah thought he’d be too
sick”—Sykes was muttering to himself when the
whirr began again, closer, right underfoot this time.
Long before this, Sykes’ ability to think had been
flattened down to primitive instinct and he leaped—onto
the bed.</p>

<p>Outside Delia heard a cry that might have come
from a maddened chimpanzee, a stricken gorilla.
All the terror, all the horror, all the rage that man
possibly could express, without a recognizable human
sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>A tremendous stir inside there, another series of
animal screams, the intermittent whirr of the reptile.
The shade torn violently down from the window,
letting in the red dawn, a huge brown hand
seizing the window stick, great dull blows upon the
wooden floor punctuating the gibberish of sound
long after the rattle of the snake had abruptly subsided.
All this Delia could see and hear from her
place beneath the window, and it made her ill. She
crept over to the four-o’clocks and stretched herself
on the cool earth to recover.</p>

<p>She lay there. “Delia, Delia!” She could hear
Sykes calling in a most despairing tone as one who
expected no answer. The sun crept on up, and he
called. Delia could not move—her legs were gone
flabby. She never moved, he called, and the sun
kept rising.</p>

<p>“Mah Gawd!” She heard him moan, “Mah
Gawd fum Heben!” She heard him stumbling
about and got up from her flower-bed. The sun was
growing warm. As she approached the door she
heard him call out hopefully, “Delia, is dat you Ah
heah?”</p>

<p>She saw him on his hands and knees as soon as she
reached the door. He crept an inch or two toward
her—all that he was able, and she saw his horribly
swollen neck and his one open eye shining with hope.
A surge of pity too strong to support bore her away
from that eye that must, could not, fail to see the
tubs. He would see the lamp. Orlando with its
doctors was too far. She could scarcely reach the
Chinaberry tree, where she waited in the growing
heat while inside she knew the cold river was creeping
up and up to extinguish that eye which must
know by now that she knew.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>Of all the</i> doughty societies that have sprung
up in this age of Kluxers and Beavers
the one known by that unpronounceable word,
“Intelligentsia,” is among the most benighted. The
war seems to have given it birth, the press nurtured
it, which should have been warning enough, then
the public accepted it, and now we all suffer.</p>

<p>Of course no one would admit that he is a member
of the Intelligentsia. Modern civilizing influences
do not develop that kind of candor. But it
is just as easy to spot a member of the genus as it
is to spot a Mississippian or a Chinese: the marks are
all there.</p>

<p>According to the ultra-advanced notions of the
great majority of this secret order if it were not for
the Intelligentsia this crippled old world would be
compelled to kick up its toes and die on the spot.
Were it not for these super-men all the brilliance
of the ages and the inheritance which is so vital to
the maintenance of the spark of progress would vanish
and pass away. In other words if the Intelligentsia
were to stick their divinely appointed noses a
little higher into the ethereal regions and withdraw
themselves completely from the tawdry field of life
that field would soon become a burial ground for
the rest of humanity.</p>

<p>This is the rankest folly. The world owes about
as much to the rank and file of this society as a
Negro slave owes to Georgia. Besides a few big
words added to the lexicon and one or two hifalutin’
notions about the way the world should be run, the
contribution of Intelligentsia to society is as negligible
as gin at a Methodist picnic. This is not to
discount the many notable contributions by really intelligent
men and women who didn’t know that such
a society existed until insignificant nincompoops
with their eyes set towards enhancing their own
positions in society, made them honorary members.</p>

<p>What is intelligence anyway? If you ask a member
of the Intelligentsia he will probably sneer at
you and ask who wants to know. The Intelligentsia
are very particular about observing the admonition
against putting a herd of swine on an oyster diet,
so particular in fact that they have become much
more adept at discovering pigpens than they are at
digging pearls. But if you ask a truly intelligent
person he will tell you in a jiffy that intelligence is
simply the ability to solve a new problem, nothing
more, nothing less.</p>

<p>Now that is just what the average member of the
Intelligentsia does not do. He does not solve new
problems, he makes them; then he leaves it to the
true intellectuals to solve them. Sift the chaff out
of Intelligentsia and you will find that the residuum
is about fifty-six one hundredths of one per cent.
For the rest, the society is made up of non-producers
and bloodsuckers who feed voraciously on the bones
which the true intellectuals pass on to them to pick
over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>The average member of Intelligentsia comes as
near being a true intellectual as the proverbial hot
water in which resides a cabbage leaf comes to being
stew. His earmarks are abundant information about
the most recent literature, an obsession for the latest
shows, wild notions about art in general, along
with a flair for disdaining Babbits, and for feigning
spiritual chumminess with the true intellectuals
who are accomplishing things.</p>

<p>He reads H. L. M. and George Jean Nathan,
knows his Freud from cover to cover, and has an
ability for spotting morons which is positively as uncanny
as the ability of a Texas bloodhound to sniff
a nigger. If he’s a man he is as incapable of attending
to his own affairs and doing something once in
a while, as a hobo is incapable of paying a month’s
rent. All this goes for the feminine Intelligentsia,
with this added distinction—they sneer at every
homely virtue, including taking care of babies and
frying eggs without breaking the yolks.</p>

<p>Far be it from me to sing paens to the days when
men amused themselves with dominoes and the fair
sex waded through enough dishwater to make a
Jordan. Those days and their folk hold no illusions
for me. But it is high time that a halt is called on
these snobbish sycophantish highbrow hero-worshippers
who, having got a smattering of wisdom from
one of the fifty-seven hundred purveyors of this rare
article in America, deign to damn with their sneers
and jibes any activity, institution, or mortal it strikes
their fancy to treat in such a manner.</p>

<p>These are the folk who talk Bolshevism in their
parlors and wouldn’t go to Russia if it were placed,
like milk for cats, in saucers on their doorsteps.
They slur Beethoven or Tennyson and extol Stravinsky
and Whitman when they are hardly able to
grasp such simple minded folk as Leybach or Longfellow,
or even Eddie Guest himself.</p>

<p>They mull over best sellers and can call authors’
names by the scores. Literature for them is measured
by its mystic qualities or its pornographical
settings; music by its aberrations from generally
accepted forms; art by its illusiveness.</p>

<p>Anything that is plain or clear or clean comes
under the suspicion of these folk if not actually
beneath their contempt. They who themselves do
almost nothing by way of contributing to the nation’s
artistic development set themselves up as the
struggling workman’s severest critics. Ofttimes
they are actually proud of their non-accomplishment:
it shows their artistic temperament, they
boast. Good God deliver us from their art!</p>

<p>One can admire truly intellectual types like Sinclair
Lewis, Dreiser, H.L.M., and Shaw, men who
are in every respect creative critics and thinkers.
What one cannot swallow is this carrion prostrated
at the altar of Liberalism when as a matter of fact
their lying hearts are as faint as they are insipid.
Their pelts are as mangy as Main Streeters’ and
their sentiments as hypocritical as those of the most
pious Kluxer in the Bible Belt. They are by far
more to be despised than the “morons” whom they
single out with such avidity; for the latter do at least
make an attempt to earn their salt, and to express
themselves honestly, while the Intelligentsia steal all
they can get away with and never do anything unless
it be in the attitude of a dethroned prince who
suddenly has to go to work.</p>

<p>These folk have no more right to become associated
with true artistic spirits than Knights of Columbus
have to drink the Grand Kleagle’s health. They
simply give art and artists a black eye with their
snobbery and stupidity; and their false interpretations
and hypocritical evaluations do more to
heighten suspicion against the real artist on the part
of the ordinary citizen than perhaps any other single
factor in the clash of art and provincialism.</p>

<p>Certainly there is more excuse for innocent idiocy
and moronesia than there is for the sophisticated
bigotry of these fair folk who, in the secret recesses
of their inner consciousness, lay claim to membership
in the Intelligentsia.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>Some time ago</i>, while reviewing Carl Van
Vechten’s lava laned Nigger Heaven I made
the prophecy that Harlem Negroes, once their
aversion to the “nigger” in the title was forgotten,
would erect a statue on the corner of 135th Street
and Seventh Avenue, and dedicate it to this ultra-sophisticated
Iowa New Yorker.</p>

<p>So far my prophecy has failed to pan out, and
superficially it seems as if it never will, for instead
of being enshrined for his pseudo-sophisticated, semi-serious,
semi-ludicrous effusion about Harlem, Mr.
Van Vechten is about to be lynched, at least in
effigy.</p>

<p>Yet I am loathe to retract or to temper my first
prophecy. Human nature is too perverse and prophecies
do not necessarily have to be fulfilled within a
generation. Rather, they can either be fulfilled or
else belied with startling two-facedness throughout
a series of generations, which, of course, creates the
possibility that the fulfillments may outnumber the
beliements and thus gain credence for the prophecy
with posterity. Witness the Bible.</p>

<p>However, in defending my prophecy I do not
wish to endow Mr. Van Vechten’s novel (?) with
immortality, but there is no real reason why Nigger
Heaven should not eventually be as stupidly acclaimed
as it is now being stupidly damned by the
majority of Harlem’s dark inhabitants. Thus I
defiantly reiterate that a few years hence Mr. Van
Vechten will be spoken of as a kindly gent rather
than as a moral leper exploiting people who had believed
him to be a sincere friend.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_smallbreak_11" style="width: 5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_smallbreak.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>I for one, and strange as it may sound, there are
others, who believe that Carl Van Vechten was
rendered sincere during his explorations and observations
of Negro life in Harlem, even if he remained
characteristically superficial. Superficiality does
not necessarily denote a lack of sincerity, and even
superficiality may occasionally delve into deep pots
of raw life. What matter if they be flesh pots?</p>

<p>In writing Nigger Heaven the author wavered
between sentimentality and sophistication. That
the sentimentality won out is his funeral. That
the sophistication stung certain Negroes to the quick
is their funeral.</p>

<p>The odds are about even. Harlem cabarets have
received another public boost and are wearing out
cash register keys, and entertainers’ throats and
orchestra instruments. The so-called intelligentsia
of Harlem has exposed its inherent stupidity. And
Nigger Heaven is a best seller.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_smallbreak_12" style="width: 5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_smallbreak.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Group criticism of current writings, morals, life,
politics, or religion is always ridiculous, but what
could be more ridiculous than the wholesale condemnation
of a book which only one-tenth of the
condemnators have or will read. And even if the
book was as vile, as degrading, and as defamatory
to the character of the Harlem Negro as the Harlem
Negro now declares, his criticisms would not be considered
valid by an intelligent person as long as the
critic had had no reading contact with the book.</p>

<p>The objectors to Nigger Heaven claim that the
author came to Harlem, ingratiated himself with
Harlem folk, and then with a supercilious grin and
a salacious smirk, lolled at his desk downtown and
dashed off a pornographic document about uptown
in which all of the Negro characters are pictured
as being debased, lecherous creatures not at all
characteristic or true to type, and that, moreover,
the author provokes the impression that all of Harlem’s
inhabitants are cabaret hounds and thirsty
neurotics. He did not tell, say his critics, of our
well bred, well behaved church-going majorities,
nor of our night schools filled with eager elders,
nor of our brilliant college youth being trained in
the approved contemporary manner, nor of our
quiet, home loving thousands who hardly know
what the word cabaret connotes. He told only of
lurid night life and of uninhibited sybarites. Therefore,
since he has done these things and neglected to
do these others the white people who read the book
will believe that all Harlem Negroes are like the
Byrons, the Lascas, the Pettijohns, the Rubys, the
Creepers, the Bonifaces, and the other lewd hussies
and whoremongers in the book.</p>

<p>It is obvious that these excited folk do not realize
that any white person who would believe such
poppy-cock probably believes it anyway, without
any additional aid from Mr. Van Vechten, and
should such a person read a tale anent our non-cabareting,
church-going Negroes, presented in all
their virtue and glory and with their human traits,
their human hypocrisy and their human perversities
glossed over, written, say, by Jessie Fauset, said person
would laugh derisively and allege that Miss
Fauset had not told the truth, the same as Harlem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
Negroes are alleging that Carl Van Vechten has not
told the truth. It really makes no difference to the
race’s welfare what such ignoramuses think, and it
would seem that any author preparing to write about
Negroes in Harlem or anywhere else (for I hear
that DuBose Heyward has been roundly denounced
by Charlestonian Negroes for his beautiful Porgy)
should take whatever phases of their life that seem
the most interesting to him, and develop them as
he pleases. Why Negroes imagine that any writer
is going to write what Negroes think he ought to
write about them is too ridiculous to merit consideration.
It would seem that they would shy
away from being pigeon-holed so long have they
been the rather lamentable victims of such a typically
American practice, yet Negroes would have all Negroes
appearing in contemporary literature made as
ridiculous and as false to type as the older school
of pseudo-humorous, sentimental white writers made
their Uncle Toms, they Topsys, and their Mammies,
or as the Octavius Roy Cohen school now make their
more modern “cullud” folk.</p>

<p>One young lady, prominent in Harlem collegiate
circles, spoke forth in a public forum (oh yes,
they even have public forums where they spend
their time announcing that they have not read the
book, and that the author is a moral leper who also
commits literary sins), that there was only one character
in Nigger Heaven who was true to type. This
character, the unwitting damsel went on, was Mary
Love. It seems as if all the younger Negro women
in Harlem are prototypes of this Mary Love, and
it is pure, poor, virtuous, vapid Mary, to whom
they point as a typical life model.</p>

<p>Again there has been no realization that Mary
Love is the least life-like character in the book, or
that it is she who suffers most from her creator’s
newly acquired seriousness and sentimentality, she
who suffers most of the whole ensemble because her
creator discovered, in his talented trippings around
Manhattan, drama at which he could not chuckle
the while his cavalier pen sped cleverly on in the
same old way yet did not—could not spank.</p>

<p>But—had all the other characters in Nigger
Heaven approximated Mary’s standard, the statue
to Carl Van Vechten would be an actualized instead
of a deferred possibility, and my prophecy would be
gloriously fulfilled instead of being ignominiously
belied.</p>
